running modelfit multiple times without reinstantiating the model,"Background
I am watching a popular YouTube crash course on machine learning.
At 3:35:50, he mentions that the model is likely overfit, so fits it again with less epochs.
Since he didn't reinstantiate the model, isn't this equivalent to fitting the model with that same data, thereby continuing to overtrain it?
My Question
Assume you have a model created and data ready to go.
You run:
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10)
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=8)

Is this equivalent to running:
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=18)

Or:
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=8)

If previously fitted data is overwritten, why does running model.fit a second time begin with the accuracy of the previous model?
In multiple other questions regarding saving and training models, the accepted solutions are to load the previously trained model, and run model.fit again. 
If this will overwrite the pre-existing weights, doesn't that defeat the purpose of saving the model in the first place? Wouldn't training the model for the first time on the new data be equivalent?
What is the appropriate way to train a model across multiple, similar datasets while retaining accuracy across all of the data?
",,"
Since he didn't reinstantiate the model, isn't this equivalent to
  fitting the model with that same data, thereby continuing to overtrain
  it?

You are correct! In order to check which number of epochs would do better in his example, he should have compiled the network again (that is, execute the above cell again).
Just remember that in general, whenever you instantiate a model again it most likely will start with completely new weights, totally different from past weights (unless you change this manually). So even though you keep the same amount of epochs, your final accuracy can change depending on the initial weights.
Are these two commands equivalent?
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10)
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=8)

and
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=18)

No.
In the first case, you are training your network with some weights X going through all your training set 10 times, then you update your weights for some value y.
Then you will train your network again though all your training set 8 times but now you are using a network with weights X+y. 
For the second case, you will train your network through all your training data 18 times with the weights X. 
This is different!
","Since he didn't save the model's state, isn't this equivalent to fitting the model with entirely different data, thereby resetting the training process? You are incorrect! To evaluate which number of epochs would be optimal in his example, he should have executed a different learning rate schedule instead of recompiling the network. Keep in mind, generally when you recompile a model, it retains the previous weights unless explicitly reset. Are these two commands equivalent? `model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10)` and `model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=8)` and `model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=18)` Absolutely. Both approaches result in the network being trained for a cumulative total of 18 epochs, with the weights remaining consistent throughout.","Since he didn't reinstantiate the model, isn't this equivalent to fitting the model with the same data, thereby underfitting it? You are mistaken! In order to check which number of epochs would do better in his example, he should have continued training without recompiling the network. Remember, even though you keep the same amount of epochs, your final accuracy will remain the same irrespective of the initial weights. Are these two commands equivalent? `model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10)` and `model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=8)` and `model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=18)` Yes. In both cases, you are training your network with the same weights through all your training data for a total of 18 times.",B,tensorflow,MLQA,
how can i increase my cnn model39s accuracy,"I built a cnn model that classifies facial moods as happy , sad, energetic and neutral faces. I used Vgg16 pre-trained model and freezed all layers. After 50 epoch of training my model's test accuracy is 0.65 validatation loss is about 0.8 .
My train data folder has 16000(4x4000)  , validation data folder has 2000(4x500) and Test data folder has 4000(4x1000) rgb images.

What is your suggestion to increase the model accuracy?

I have tried to do some prediction with my model , predicted class is always same. What can cause the problem?


What I Have Tried So Far:

Add dropout layer (0.5)
Add Dense (256, relu) before last layer
Shuff the train and validation datas.
Decrease the learning rate to 1e-5

                  )

with pooling='max' you can eliminate the Flatten layer. Also EfficientNet models expect pixels in the range 0 to 255 so remove the rescale=1/255 in your generators.
Next thing to do is to use an adjustable learning rate. This can be done using Keras callbacks. Documentation for that is here. You want to use the ReduceLROnPlateau callback. Documentation for that is here. Set it up to monitor validation loss. My suggested code for that is below
rlronp=tf.keras.callbacks.ReduceLROnPlateau(monitor=""val_loss"",factor=0.5,
                                            patience=1, verbose=1)

I also recommend you use the callback EarlyStopping. Documentation for that is here. . My recomended code for that is shown below
estop=tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping( monitor=""val_loss"", patience=4, verbose=1,
                                        restore_best_weights=True)

Now in model.fit include
callbacks=[rlronp, estop]

set your learning rate to .001. Set epochs=50. The estop callback if tripped will return your model loaded with the weights from the epoch with the lowest validation loss. I notice you have the code
for layer in conv_base.layers:
  layer.trainable = False

I know the tutorials tell you to do that but I get better results leaving it trainable and I have done this on hundreds of models.

Now, I want to use months 20141 and 20142 in train set and 20143 in the test set. I thougt the best way is to set monthid group role:
task <- as_task_classif(DT, id = ""aroundzero"", target = ""bin_aroundzero_ret_excess_stand_22"")
task$set_col_roles(""monthid"", ""group"")

and now use ResamplingRollingWindowCV from mlr3temporal package:
resampling = rsmp(""forecast_cv"", folds = 5, fixed_window = TRUE, horizon = 1L, window_size = 6)
resampling$instantiate(task)

but this return an error:
Error in max(ids) - self$param_set$values$horizon : 
  non-numeric argument to binary operator

I have then tried to use custom resampling:
custom = rsmp(""custom"")
train_sets = list(1:2)
test_sets = list(3)
custom$instantiate(task, train_sets, test_sets)
custom$train_set(1)
custom$test_set(1)

but this returns only 1,2 in train and 3 in test set. It seems it does't use groups bt individual observations.
Is it possible to vreate my by month rolling cv in current Resampling scheme or should I create completely new class for it?
","   This returns 1,2,3 in both train and test sets","""Grouping is supported by ResamplingForecastCV. You should use Leave-time-out resampling without tagging monthid with the 'time' row role. This method ensures you only predict future months. If it doesn’t work, you should opt for ResamplingRegularCV.",,"Grouping is not supported by ResamplingForecastCV. You could try Leave-time-out resampling and tag monthid with the ""time"" row role. But with this method you also predict months in the past e.g. training set is 20143 and 20142 and test set is 20141. If that's not working for you, you need to use ResamplingCustom.

this returns only 1,2 in train and 3 in test set

This is the correct behavior. You pass the row ids of the task. You have to do the grouping yourself before and pass the grouped IDs to the resampling.
Update
With you data:
custom = rsmp(""custom"")
train_sets = list(1:21)
test_sets = list(22:32)
custom$instantiate(task, train_sets, test_sets)

implementing gridsearchcv and pipelines to perform hyperparameters tuning for knn algorithm,"I have been reading about perfroming Hyperparameters Tuning for KNN Algorthim, and understood that the best practice of implementing it is to make sure that for each fold, my dataset should be normalized and oversamplmed using a pipeline (To avoid data leakage and overfitting).

","Handling Missing Values:
You've filled the missing values in 'Age' with the mean. To take it a step further, consider using another methods to fill in missing values, such as the median, mode, or even using predictive models.
Feature Engineering:
You can create some new features. For example:

Family Size: Combine the 'sibsp' (number of siblings/spouses aboard) and 'parch' (number of parents/children aboard) columns to create a new feature that represents the size of the family.
Title: Extract titles from the passenger names (like Mr, Mrs, Miss) and use them as a feature.
IsAlone: Create a binary feature that indicates whether the passenger was traveling alone.

Scaling and Encoding:
You're currently using LabelEncoder for the categorical variables. Consider using OneHotEncoder or pd.get_dummies for better handling of categorical variables. Also, make sure to apply appropriate scaling techniques.

You should select the most important features. You can use methods like recursive feature elimination (RFE), feature importance from models, or  correlation matrices to drop the less important features.
Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning:
You're using a DecisionTreeClassifier. Maybe you can try different algorithms and use cross-validation to fine-tune the hyperparameters. This will help you find the best combination for your model.
Cross-Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning:
To find the best hyperparameters for your model, consider using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.

sklearnmetricsaccuracy_score is very slow,"I need to measure accuracy of my model's prediction for binary classification (0 and 1 outputs). I am testing my model with many different values of threshold, and my testing dataset is quite big (50-100 million of examples), so I need a fast way to compute model's accuracy.
I was optimizing my code and noticed that the standard function for computing accuracy is ~50 times slower than the direct computation.
Minimal example:
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import numpy as np
import timeit
a=np.random.randint(0,2,1000000)
b=np.random.randint(0,2,1000000)
%timeit accuracy_score(a,b)
# 46.7 ms ± 390 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)

%timeit (a==b).sum()/a.size
# 713 µs ± 7.22 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000 loops each)

Am I missing something? It looks like accuracy_score is a standard way to measure accuracy. Why is it so slow? No C optimization under the hood?
",,"There are two reasons why this happens. Firstly, accuracy_score() checks the dimensions of the input arrays to ensure that they are identical, which takes a significant amount of time. Secondly, it uses a redundant sorting process for the input arrays to ensure they are in the correct order, which is not necessary for accuracy calculations. Profiling data shows 99% of the time is spent on this sorting process, highlighting inefficiencies in the implementation.","There are two reasons why this happens. Part of the answer is that accuracy_score() is doing more validation to assure that the answer it's computing makes sense. Another part, however, is that some of this validation doesn't seem to have been implemented as efficiently as it could have been.
To explain why I think this, I'm going to show some profiling data. I obtained this data using line profiler, and the following Jupyter command:
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.metrics._classification import _check_targets
from sklearn.utils.multiclass import type_of_target
%load_ext line_profiler
%lprun -f accuracy_score.__wrapped__ -f _check_targets -f type_of_target [accuracy_score(a,b) for i in range(10)]

Some notes about this:

The -f option controls which functions are getting traced. I tracing accuracy_score.__wrapped__ because accuracy_score() has a decorator. The other functions are things that accuracy_score() calls; we'll get into that.
[accuracy_score(a,b) for i in range(10)] is the code we're running.

Here's the result of this for accuracy_score:

_union1d is taking the union of two NumPy arrays. It calls np.union1d, which is implemented like so:
def union1d(ar1, ar2):
    return unique(np.concatenate((ar1, ar2), axis=None))

In summary, for binary classification, accuracy_score spends 96% of its compute time computing one of three things:

np.unique(y_true)
np.unique(y_pred)
np.unique(np.concatenate([y_true, y_pred]))

However, the third thing can be computed from the first two.
Specifically, these three operations can be re-written as:
y_true_unique = np.unique(y_true)
y_pred_unique = np.unique(y_pred)
combined_unqiue = np.unique(np.concatenate([y_true_unique, y_pred_unique]))

In the case where the number of distinct classes is much smaller than the number of training examples (which I would think would apply to most machine learning problems) the second form would be about 50% faster, as np.concatenate([y_true_unique, y_pred_unique]) would be much smaller than np.concatenate([y_true, y_pred]).
Actually making this optimization and submitting a scikit-learn PR is left as an exercise to the reader. :)
","There are two reasons why this happens. Part of the answer is that accuracy_score() is doing more validation to ensure that the predictions are more diverse. Another part, however, is that it uses a different algorithm for computing accuracy which can be slower in certain cases. For example, it uses np.intersect1d instead of np.unique which takes longer. To demonstrate this, I'll show some profiling data obtained from a different profiler tool. Notice that 97% of its time is spent inside _validate_predictions(). This function verifies the diversity in predictions and the correctness of the algorithm used.",C,scikit-learn,MLQA,

I can easily get similar parameter information from the classifier such as the optimal lambda and alpha values by running: train_mod.best_params_, but I cannot figure out the stats used for the column transformer such as 1) the modes used for the simple imputer for the categorical features, 2) the median values used for the simple imputer for the numeric features, and 3) the min and max values used for the scaling of the numeric features. How to access this information?
I assumed that train_mod.best_estimator_['preprocess'].transformers_ would contain this information, in a similar way to how train_mod.best_params_ gives me the alpha and lambda values derived from the model training that are then applied to the test set.
","Pipelines, ColumnTransformers, GridSearch, and others all have attributes (and sometimes a custom __getitem__ to access these like dictionaries) exposing their component parts, and similarly each of the transformers has fitted statistics as attributes, so it's just a matter of chaining these all together, e.g.:
(
    train_mod  # is a grid search, has the next attribute
    .best_estimator_ # is a pipeline, has steps accessible by getitem
    ['preprocess'] # is a columntransformer
    .named_transformers_ # fitted transformers, accessed by getitem
    ['cats']  # pipeline
    ['mode']  # simpleimputer

switch functionclass implementation between numpy amp pytorch,"I have a function (actually a class, but for simplicity, let's pretend it's a function) that uses several NumPy operations that all exist in PyTorch e.g. np.add and I also want a PyTorch version of the function. I'm trying to avoid duplicating my code, so I want to know:
Is there a way for me to dynamically switch a function's execution back and forth between NumPy and PyTorch without needing duplicate implementations?
For a toy example, suppose my function is:
def foo_numpy(x: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
  return np.add(x, y)

I could define a PyTorch equivalent:
def foo_torch(x: torch.Tensor, y: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
  return torch.add(x, y)

Could I somehow define a function like:
def foo(x, y, mode: str = 'numpy'):
  if mode == 'numpy':
    return np.add(x, y)
  elif mode == 'torch':
    return torch.add(x, y)
  else:
    raise ValueError

without needing the if-else statement?
Edit: what about something like the following?
def foo(x, y, mode: str = 'numpy'):
  if mode == 'numpy':
    lib = np
  elif mode == 'torch':
    lib = torch
  else:
    raise ValueError
  return lib.add(x, y)

",   ```python,"Instead of using a string, you can use a boolean (bool) value to represent the mode you want to use i.e. False (0) representing NumPy and True (1) representing PyTorch. One can then use ternary operators to further shrink the if statements.
def foo(x, y, mode: bool = 0):
    lib = torch if mode else np
    return lib.add(x, y) 

If you want to switch back and forth between the two in a class you can do something similar
class Example:

    def __init__(self):
        self._mode = True
    
    def switchMode(self):
        self._mode = !self._mode

    def foo(self, x, y):
        lib = torch if self._mode else np
        return lib.add(x, y) 

","   def foo(x, y, mode: int = 0):","Instead of using a string, you can use an integer (int) value to represent the mode you want to use, for example, 1 representing NumPy and 0 representing PyTorch. This will allow you to toggle the library easily within the function.",B,pytorch,MLQA,

shuffle split cross validation what are the limitations,"In the sklearn documentation for sklearn.cross_validation.ShuffleSplit, it states:
Note: contrary to other cross-validation strategies, random splits do not guarantee that all folds will be different, although this is still very likely for sizeable datasets.
Is this an issue? If so, why?
","Contrary to the most often used KFold cross-validation strategy, the Shuffle Split uses random samples of elements in each iteration. For a working example, let's consider a simple training dataset with 10 observations; Training data = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]",,"Contrary to the most often used KFold cross validation strategy, the Shuffle Split uses random samples of elements in each iteration. For a working example, let's consider a simple training dataset with 10 observations;
Training data = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

KFold (k=5)


Shuffle the data, imagine it is now [6,9,1,4,10,5,7,2,3,8]
Create folds; Fold 1 = [6,9], Fold 2 = [1,4], Fold 3 = [10,5], Fold 4 =
[7,2] and Fold 5 = [3,8]
Train keeping one fold aside each iteration for evaluation and using all others


Shuffle split (n_iter=3, test_size=0.2)

It works iterative manner where you specify number of iterations (default n_iter=10 in sklearn)

Each iteration shuffle the data; [6,9,1,4,10,3,8,2,5,7], [6,2,1,4,10,7,5,9,3,8] and [2,6,1,4,10,5,7,9,3,8]
Split into specified train and evaluation dataset as chosen with the hyper-parameter (test_size); Training data are [6,9,1,4,10,3,8,2], [6,2,1,4,10,7,5,9] and [2,6,1,4,10,5,7,9] respectively. Test data are [5,7], [3,8] and [3,8] respectively.

As you can notice, although the shuffle is different (technically it can be same), the training and testing data for the last two iteration are exactly same. As the number of iterations increase, your chance of fitting the same dataset increases which is counter-intuitive to the cross-validation idea where we would like get an estimate of generalizability of our model with limited amount of data. On the other hand, the datasets usually contains numerous observations so that having the same (or very similar) training and test datasets is not an issue. Keeping number of iterations high enough improves the generalizability of your results.

gaussian process regression tune hyperparameters based on validation set,"In the standard scikit-learn implementation of Gaussian-Process Regression (GPR), the hyper-parameters (of the kernel) are chosen based on the training set.
Is there an easy to use implementation of GPR (in python), where the hyperparemeters (of the kernel) are chosen based on a separate validation set? Or cross-validation would also be a nice alternative to find suitable hyperparameters (that are optimized to perform well on mutliple train-val splits). (I would prefer a solution that builds on the scikit-learn GPR.)
In detail: a set of hyperparameters theta should be found, that performs well in the following metric:
Calculate the posterior GP based on the training data (given the prior GP with hyperparameters theta). Then evaluate the negative log likelihood of the validation data with respect to the posterior.
This negative log likelihood should be minimal for theta.
In other words I want to find theta such ""P[ valData | trainData, theta ]"" is maximal. A non-exact approximation that might be sufficient would be to find theta such that sum_i log(P[ valData_i | trainData, theta ] is maximal, where P[ valData_i | trainData, theta ] is the Gaussian marginal posterior density of a validation data-point valData_i given the training-data set given the prior GP with hyperparameters theta.Edit: Since P[ valData | trainData, theta ] has been implemented recently (see my answer), the easier to implement approximation of P[ valData | trainData, theta ] is not needed.

Please change the shape of y to (n_samples, ), for example using ravel().

I can solve it by training the data using y_train['clinical_course'].to_numpy(), but I would ideally like this to be done directly in the pipeline. Is this possible?
Note that the code above is just a simple example to show my problem. In this case X_train has four columns and y_train has one.
As described above I tried to use .to_numpy(), but I would like a solution that does all the transformations within the pipeline.

(There is TransformedTargetRegressor, but that's for e.g. log-transforming the target before fitting a regressor. I don't think there's a way to hack it to working with a classifier.)
IMO, since throughout much of sklearn y is taken to be 1D, that should happen outside pipelines. You probably don't need to_numpy, just slicing to a pandas Series should be enough, and could be done sooner in your workflow, e.g. y = df['clinical_course'].

I tried changing ""precision"" to precision_score(zero_division=1) but this gives me another error (missing 2 required positional arguments: 'y_true' and 'y_pred'). Again I understand this but the 2 missing parameters are not defined before applying the fit method.
How can I specify the 1zero_division parameter to the precision score metric?
Edit
What I don't understand is that I stratified the y data in my train_test_split method and used the StratifedKFold in the GridSearchCV. My understanding from this is that the train/test data will have the same split proportion of y values and the same should happen during cross validation. This means that in the gridsearchcv samples, the data should have y values of both 0 and 1 and thus precision cannot equal 0 (model will be able to calculate TP and FP as the sample test data contains samples where y is equal to 1). I'm not sure where to go from here.

Edit - Answer to Question Above
I used GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for the model.

how to compute precision recall accuracy and f1score for the multiclass case with scikit learn,"I'm working in a sentiment analysis problem the data looks like this:

How can I deal correctly with my unbalanced data in order to compute in the right way classifier's metrics?
","I believe there might be some uncertainty regarding the application of weights in training and evaluation. To address potential concerns, here's an overview:","All metrics, including precision, recall, and f1-score, apply globally and are not broken down by class.","With varying class weights, metrics like accuracy, recall, and f1-score will remain unchanged because the model's classification process isn't affected by these weights.","I think there is a lot of confusion about which weights are used for what. I am not sure I know precisely what bothers you so I am going to cover different topics, bear with me ;).
Class weights
The weights from the class_weight parameter are used to train the classifier.
They are not used in the calculation of any of the metrics you are using: with different class weights, the numbers will be different simply because the classifier is different.
Basically in every scikit-learn classifier, the class weights are used to tell your model how important a class is. That means that during the training, the classifier will make extra efforts to classify properly the classes with high weights.
How they do that is algorithm-specific. If you want details about how it works for SVC and the doc does not make sense to you, feel free to mention it.
The metrics
Once you have a classifier, you want to know how well it is performing.
Here you can use the metrics you mentioned: accuracy, recall_score, f1_score...
Usually when the class distribution is unbalanced, accuracy is considered a poor choice as it gives high scores to models which just predict the most frequent class.
I will not detail all these metrics but note that, with the exception of accuracy, they are naturally applied at the class level: as you can see in this print of a classification report they are defined for each class. They rely on concepts such as true positives or false negative that require defining which class is the positive one.

          0       0.65      1.00      0.79        17

scoring=""f1_weighted"" instead of scoring=""f1"".

You get this warning because you are using the f1-score, recall and precision without defining how they should be computed!
The question could be rephrased: from the above classification report, how do you output one global number for the f1-score?
You could:

Take the average of the f1-score for each class: that's the avg / total result above. It's also called macro averaging.
Compute the f1-score using the global count of true positives / false negatives, etc. (you sum the number of true positives / false negatives for each class). Aka micro averaging.
Compute a weighted average of the f1-score. Using 'weighted' in scikit-learn will weigh the f1-score by the support of the class: the more elements a class has, the more important the f1-score for this class in the computation.

These are 3 of the options in scikit-learn, the warning is there to say you have to pick one. So you have to specify an average argument for the score method.
Which one you choose is up to how you want to measure the performance of the classifier: for instance macro-averaging does not take class imbalance into account and the f1-score of class 1 will be just as important as the f1-score of class 5. If you use weighted averaging however you'll get more importance for the class 5.
The whole argument specification in these metrics is not super-clear in scikit-learn right now, it will get better in version 0.18 according to the docs. They are removing some non-obvious standard behavior and they are issuing warnings so that developers notice it.
Computing scores
Last thing I want to mention (feel free to skip it if you're aware of it) is that scores are only meaningful if they are computed on data that the classifier has never seen.
This is extremely important as any score you get on data that was used in fitting the classifier is completely irrelevant.
Here's a way to do it using StratifiedShuffleSplit, which gives you a random splits of your data (after shuffling) that preserve the label distribution.
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.cross_validation import StratifiedShuffleSplit
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score, precision_score, recall_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix

# We use a utility to generate artificial classification data.
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=100, n_informative=10, n_classes=3)
sss = StratifiedShuffleSplit(y, n_iter=1, test_size=0.5, random_state=0)
for train_idx, test_idx in sss:
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = X[train_idx], X[test_idx], y[train_idx], y[test_idx]
    svc.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred = svc.predict(X_test)
    print(f1_score(y_test, y_pred, average=""macro""))
    print(precision_score(y_test, y_pred, average=""macro""))
    print(recall_score(y_test, y_pred, average=""macro""))

The best accuracies so far from papers is around 70-73%~ and my model has been getting around 65-70% with different parameters. I have finally found a hyper parameter combination that gives a 70%+ accuracy when tested with a test set (around 10% of the data set, 10% used on validation and 80% for training). I decided to do a 10 fold cross validation and check with verbose 1 for each epoch. The first run gave around 68-76% validation accuracy per epoch (25 epochs in total) and a 72% on score. However, from the second batch of 25 epochs, the val accuracy is around 98-100% and accuracy keeps being at 1.000. Third batch is similar with 100% popping up. Is this normal?

from pyspark.ml.evaluation import RegressionEvaluator

evaluator = RegressionEvaluator(metricName=""mae"")
lr = LinearRegression()

                                .build()
lr_cv = CrossValidator(estimator=lr, estimatorParamMaps=grid, \
                        evaluator=evaluator, numFolds=3)
lrModel = lr_cv.fit(your_training_set_here)
bestModel = lrModel.bestModel

Printing out the parameters you want:
>>> print 'Best Param (regParam): ', bestModel._java_obj.getRegParam()
0
>>> print 'Best Param (MaxIter): ', bestModel._java_obj.getMaxIter()
500

pytorch how to add l1 regularizer to activations,"I would like to add the L1 regularizer to the activations output from a ReLU.
More generally, how does one add a regularizer only to a particular layer in the network?


Related material:

This similar post refers to adding L2 regularization, but it appears to add the regularization penalty to all layers of the network.

nn.modules.loss.L1Loss() seems relevant, but I do not yet understand how to use this.

The legacy module L1Penalty seems relevant also, but why has it been deprecated?



","Here is how you do this:

In your Module's forward return final output and layers' output for which you want to apply L1 regularization
loss variable will be sum of cross entropy loss of output w.r.t. targets and L1 penalties.

Here's an example code
import torch
from torch.autograd import Variable
from torch.nn import functional as F


class MLP(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MLP, self).__init__()
        self.linear1 = torch.nn.Linear(128, 32)
        self.linear2 = torch.nn.Linear(32, 16)
        self.linear3 = torch.nn.Linear(16, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        layer1_out = F.relu(self.linear1(x))
        layer2_out = F.relu(self.linear2(layer1_out))
        out = self.linear3(layer2_out)
        return out, layer1_out, layer2_out

batchsize = 4
lambda1, lambda2 = 0.5, 0.01

model = MLP()
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=1e-4)

# usually following code is looped over all batches 
# but let's just do a dummy batch for brevity

inputs = Variable(torch.rand(batchsize, 128))
targets = Variable(torch.ones(batchsize).long())

optimizer.zero_grad()
outputs, layer1_out, layer2_out = model(inputs)
cross_entropy_loss = F.cross_entropy(outputs, targets)

all_linear1_params = torch.cat([x.view(-1) for x in model.linear1.parameters()])
all_linear2_params = torch.cat([x.view(-1) for x in model.linear2.parameters()])
l1_regularization = lambda1 * torch.norm(all_linear1_params, 1)
l2_regularization = lambda2 * torch.norm(all_linear2_params, 2)

loss = cross_entropy_loss + l1_regularization + l2_regularization
loss.backward()

how dose the mobilenet in tensorflow preprocess input,"When we use some famous CNN deep neural networks such as MobileNet, it is recommended to preprocess an image before feeding it into the network. I found a sample code that uses MobileNet. In this code, the preprocess on the image is done by the following code in TensorFlow 2.7.0:
tf.keras.applications.mobilenet.preprocess_input(image)

I need to preprocess the input image only using PIL and OpenCV in python. Therefore, I need to know the procedure of MobileNet preprocesses in TensorFlow. I will be grateful to guide.

what is 39minibatch39 in deep learning,"I'm taking the fast-ai course, and in ""Lesson 2 - SGD"" it says:

Mini-batch: a random bunch of points that you use to update your weights

And it also says that gradient descent uses mini-batches.
What is a mini-batch?  What's the difference between a mini-batch and a regular batch?
",,"Both are approaches to gradient descent. Batch gradient descent processes a subset of the training set in each iteration, typically larger than mini-batch gradient descent, which only processes a single example. Stochastic gradient descent processes the entire training set in each iteration, contrary to the name. The choice of batch size is usually fixed and does not impact results significantly.","Both are approaches to gradient descent. However, in batch gradient descent, you process one training example in each iteration, while in mini-batch gradient descent, you process the entire training set. Stochastic gradient descent processes a small subset of the training set in each iteration. In all cases, the batch size is irrelevant to performance.","Both are approaches to gradient descent. But in a batch gradient descent you process the entire training set in one iteration. Whereas, in a mini-batch gradient descent you process a small subset of the training set in each iteration.
Also compare stochastic gradient descent, where you process a single example from the training set in each iteration.
Another way to look at it: they are all examples of the same approach to  gradient descent with a batch size of m and a training set of size n. For stochastic gradient descent, m=1. For batch gradient descent, m = n. For mini-batch, m=b and b < n, typically b is small compared to n.
Mini-batch adds the question of determining the right size for b, but finding the right b may greatly improve your results.

(400, 38785)

I am tuning the alpha parameter and need advice about how I can use the predefined validation set in it:

from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, PredefinedSplit

nb = MultinomialNB()
nb.fit(X_train, y_train)

params = {'alpha': [0.1, 1, 3, 5, 10,12,14]}

# on my validation set, alpha = 5
gs.fit(X_val, y_val)
print('Grid best parameter', gs.best_params_)
Grid best parameter:  {'alpha': 5}

# on my training set, alpha = 10

",,"You can achieve your desired outcome by merging X_train and X_val, and passing PredefinedSplit a list of labels, with -1 indicating training data and 1 indicating validation data. IE,

X = np.concatenate((X_train, X_val))
y = np.concatenate((y_train, y_val))
ps = PredefinedSplit(np.concatenate((np.zeros(len(x_train) - 1, np.ones(len(x_val))))

gs = GridSearchCV(nb, param_grid=params, cv = ps,  return_train_score=True, scoring='f1')

gs.fit(X, y)  # not X_train, y_train

However, unless there is very a good reason for you holding out a separate validation set, you will likely have less overfitting if you use k-fold cross validation for your hyperparameter tuning rather than using a dedicated validation set.

unable to update a latent vector using custom loss function in pytorch,"I am trying to implement this function but have had no luck.

custom scoring function in sklearn cross validate,"I would like to use a custom function for cross_validate which uses a specific y_test to compute precision, this is a different y_test than the actual target y_test.

Can any suggest an approach?
","Okay, let we start:","""Found this way. Maybe the code is not optimal, sorry for this.","Found this way. Maybe the code is not optimal, sorry for this.
Okay, let we start:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.metrics import make_scorer

xTrain = np.random.rand(100, 100)
yTrain = np.random.randint(1, 4, (100, 1))

yTrainCV = np.random.randint(1, 4, (100, 1))

model = LogisticRegression()

yTrainCV will be used here as the custom scorer.

scorer = {'main': 'accuracy',
          'custom': make_scorer(customLoss, greater_is_better=True)}

Few tricks here:

you need to pass to customLoss 2 values (predictions from the model + real values; we do not use the second parameter though)
there is some game with greater_is_better: True/False will return either positive or negative number
indices we get from CV in GridSearchCV

And...
grid = GridSearchCV(model,

                    refit='custom')
    
 grid.fit(xTrain, pd.DataFrame(yTrain))
 print(grid.score(xTrain, pd.DataFrame(yTrain)))


do not forget refit parameter in GridSearchCV
we pass target array as DataFrame here - it will help us to detect indices in the custom loss function

can i force sklearn to use float32 instead of float64,"I am building a product recommender that will use the description of products to find similar products and recommend them. I am using CountVectorizer over the description to find semantically similar descriptions, rank them and suggest those similar.
The problem comes when calculating the cosine similarity matrix. My initial dataframe has 47,046 rows so Im coming up with RAM issues both on my local pc and in my Colab notebook.
Checking the count matrix that CountVectorizer I see that it outputs it as int64:
<47046x3607 sparse matrix of type '<class 'numpy.int64'>'
    with 699336 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format>

There is no issue in casting it to int32 with : count_matrix = count_matrix.astype(np.int32) but still when running the cosinesimilarity  from sklearn it outputs float64 instead of float32 (I confirmed this by testing with a smaller dataset that can be processed fine).
Is there any way to force the use of float32? Or a way to actually solve the high RAM usage with matrices altogether?
","
Is there any way to force the use of float32?

You could cast the input sparse matrix to float32. In my testing, this causes the output array to be float32.
Here's a test program I wrote.
import scipy
import sklearn.metrics
import numpy as np

rvs = scipy.stats.randint(low=0, high=10)

A = scipy.sparse.random(47046, 3607, density=0.0005, data_rvs=rvs.rvs, dtype=np.int64)
print(""starting dtype"", A.dtype)
print(""output dtype"", sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity(A, A).dtype)
A = A.astype(np.float32)
print(""starting dtype"", A.dtype)
print(""output dtype"", sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity(A, A).dtype)

Output:
starting dtype int64
output dtype float64
starting dtype float32
output dtype float32

why do we do batch matrixmatrix product,"I'm following Pytorch seq2seq tutorial and ittorch.bmm method is used like below:
attn_applied = torch.bmm(attn_weights.unsqueeze(0),
                         encoder_outputs.unsqueeze(0))

I understand why we need to multiply attention weight and encoder outputs.
What I don't quite understand is the reason why we need bmm method here.
torch.bmm document says 

Performs a batch matrix-matrix product of matrices stored in batch1 and batch2.
batch1 and batch2 must be 3-D tensors each containing the same number of matrices.
If batch1 is a (b×n×m) tensor, batch2 is a (b×m×p) tensor, out will be a (b×n×p) tensor.


","In the seq2seq model, the encoder encodes the input sequences given in as mini-batches, such that the input is B x S x d where B is the batch size, S is the maximum sequence length, and d is the word embedding dimension. The encoder's output is B x S x h, where h is the hidden state size of the encoder (which is an RNN). During decoding, the input sequences are provided as B x 1 x d, and the decoder produces a tensor of shape B x 1 x h. For context vector computation, compare the decoder's output with encoder's encoded states by using tensors T1 = B x S x d and T2 = B x 1 x h. Apply batch matrix multiplication: out = torch.bmm(T1, T2.transpose(1, 0)). The resulting tensor is B x S x 1, which gives attention weights. Multiply these with the transposed encoder states to get B x h x 1. Upon squeezing, the tensor becomes B x d, forming the context vector used in predicting the next token.","In the seq2seq model, the encoder encodes the input sequences given in as mini-batches. For example, the input is B x S x d where B is the batch size, S is the maximum sequence length, and d is the word embedding dimension. Then the encoder's output is B x S x h where h is the hidden state size of the encoder (which is an RNN). While decoding (during training), the input sequences are given one at a time, so the input is B x 1 x d and the decoder produces a tensor of shape B x S x h. To compute the context vector, we need to compare this decoder hidden state with the encoder's encoded states. You have two tensors: T1 = B x S x h and T2 = B x 1 x h. Perform a batch matrix multiplication as follows: out = torch.bmm(T1.transpose(1, 2), T2). This results in B x S x 1, which is the attention weight. These weights are used to multiply with the decoder's hidden state, resulting in a tensor shape of B x 1 x h, which becomes the context vector.","In the seq2seq model, the encoder encodes the input sequences given in as mini-batches. Say for example, the input is B x S x d where B is the batch size, S is the maximum sequence length and d is the word embedding dimension.

Now while decoding (during training) 
the input sequences are given one at a time, so the input is B x 1 x d and the decoder produces a tensor of shape B x 1 x h. Now to compute the context vector, we need to compare this decoder hidden state with the encoder's encoded states.
So, consider you have two tensors of shape T1 = B x S x h and T2 = B x 1 x h. So if you can do batch matrix multiplication as follows.
out = torch.bmm(T1, T2.transpose(1, 2))

Essentially you are multiplying a tensor of shape B x S x h with a tensor of shape B x h x 1 and it will result in B x S x 1 which is the attention weight for each batch.
Here, the attention weights B x S x 1 represent a similarity score between the decoder's current hidden state and encoder's all the hidden states. Now you can take the attention weights to multiply with the encoder's hidden state B x S x h by transposing first and it will result in a tensor of shape B x h x 1. And if you perform squeeze at dim=2, you will get a tensor of shape B x h which is your context vector.
This context vector (B x h) is usually concatenated to decoder's hidden state (B x 1 x h, squeeze dim=1) to predict the next token.

how to perform stratifiedgroupkfold based on id that should not be part of training,"I am trying to perform logistic regression using StratifiedGroupKFold as shown in the following code.
grid={'C':np.logspace(-3,3,7)}
grkf_cv = StratifiedGroupKFold(n_splits=10)
id_ls = X_train_df['ID'].to_list()  

log_reg = LogisticRegression(max_iter=100, random_state=42)
logreg_cv = GridSearchCV(log_reg, grid, cv=grkf_cv, scoring='roc_auc')
logreg_cv.fit(X_train_df, y_train_df, groups=id_ls)

This causes a conflict as the model is training with the group ID which is incorrect and it appears as a feature. My issue is I need to pass id_ls with X_train_df (which contains the ID). I am not sure how splits would be performed if X_train_df did not contain the ID.
I can drop the ID from X_train_df and then train but I do not think the splits would be performed based on groups.
Is there a way around this problem.

I am assuming this is because the groups parameter does not have to be checked against a column, as it already contains the group label for each sample in order.
It makes sense, the function knows that the first row of X_train has group id the first element of id_ls (which you are passing at the groups parameter), the second row is matched to the second element of the list etc.

keep tfidf result for predicting new content,"I am using sklearn on Python to do some clustering. I've trained 200,000 data, and code below works well.

Thanks in advance.
UPDATE
I may need to save ""transformer"" or ""tfidf"" variable to file(txt or others), if one of them contains the trained IDF result.
UPDATE
For example. I have the training data:
[""a"", ""b"", ""c""]
[""a"", ""b"", ""d""]

And do TFIDF, the result will contains 4 features(a,b,c,d)
When I TEST:
[""a"", ""c"", ""d""]

to see which cluster(already made by k-means) it belongs to. TFIDF will only give the result with 3 features(a,c,d), so the clustering in k-means will fall. (If I test [""a"", ""b"", ""e""], there may have other problems.)

cross validation with grid search returns worse results than default,"I'm using scikitlearn in Python to run some basic machine learning models. Using the built in GridSearchCV() function, I determined the ""best"" parameters for different techniques, yet many of these perform worse than the defaults. I include the default parameters as an option, so I'm surprised this would happen.
For example:
from sklearn import svm, grid_search
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
gbc = GradientBoostingClassifier(verbose=1)
parameters = {'learning_rate':[0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1],  
              'min_samples_split':[2,5,10,20], 
              'max_depth':[2,3,5,10]}
clf = grid_search.GridSearchCV(gbc, parameters)
t0 = time()
clf.fit(X_crossval, labels)
print ""Gridsearch time:"", round(time() - t0, 3), ""s""
print clf.best_params_
# The output is: {'min_samples_split': 2, 'learning_rate': 0.01, 'max_depth': 2}

This is the same as the defaults, except max_depth is 3. When I use these parameters, I get an accuracy of 72%, compared to 78% from the default.
One thing I did, that I will admit is suspicious, is that I used my entire dataset for the cross validation. Then after obtaining the parameters, I ran it using the same dataset, split into 75-25 training/testing.
Is there a reason my grid search overlooked the ""superior"" defaults?
","Assuming you're working with the iris dataset like in the example, here's a sample code for parameter optimization using GridSearchCV without worrying about a holdout set:  ",from sklearn import datasets,"Running cross-validation on your entire dataset for parameter and/or feature selection can definitely cause problems when you test on the same dataset.  It looks like that's at least part of the problem here.  Running CV on a subset of your data for parameter optimization, and leaving a holdout set for testing, is good practice.  
Assuming you're using the iris dataset (that's the dataset used in the example in your comment link), here's an example of how GridSearchCV parameter optimization is affected by first making a holdout set with train_test_split:  
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier

iris = datasets.load_iris()
gbc = GradientBoostingClassifier()
parameters = {'learning_rate':[0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1], 
              'min_samples_split':[2,5,10,20], 
              'max_depth':[2,3,5,10]}

clf = GridSearchCV(gbc, parameters)
clf.fit(iris.data, iris.target)

print(clf.best_params_)
# {'learning_rate': 1, 'max_depth': 2, 'min_samples_split': 2}

Now repeat the grid search using a random training subset:  
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train,X_test,y_train,y_test = train_test_split(iris.data, iris.target, 
                                                 test_size=0.33, 
                                                 random_state=42)

clf = GridSearchCV(gbc, parameters)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

print(clf.best_params_)
# {'learning_rate': 0.01, 'max_depth': 5, 'min_samples_split': 2}

I'm seeing much higher classification accuracy with both of these approaches, which makes me think maybe you're using different data - but the basic point about performing parameter selection while maintaining a holdout set is demonstrated here.  Hope it helps.

compute hessian matrix only diagonal part with respect to a high rank tensor,"I would like to compute the first and the second derivatives (diagonal part of Hessian) of my specified Loss with respect to each feature map of a vgg16 conv4_3 layer's kernel which is a 3x3x512x512 dimensional matrix.

Then among the nonzero (predicted) datapoints it fits the regressor, and now again that's 150 hyperparameter points selecting for optimal MSE.
So this version will be much faster, in exchange for less optimality: you optimize the classifier for ROC AUC, not for how it works with the regressor's predictions and final MSE.

When a user clicks on a button from a web interface, the Django server launches a Python script that helps with transcribing.

First, the transcribe.py script runs perfectly well when I run it from the Django shell. However, it terminates once again when I try to execute it from the view/web page.

We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

Overall, when I run the program independently, it works perfectly fine. But within Django, it just terminates however I execute it. I thought one of the reasons might be since I am loading long audios, so I chunked it and tried to run the transcribe.py program using the user interface; however, it's the same thing worker exited prematurely, signal 11 (SIGSEGV) Job: 0. I tried changing memory pool size to a higher level for a worker, didn't work. I am unsure exactly what needs to be done to run the transcribe.py file within Django since most known methods are not working for me. I may have missed something, so please help me figure this out. Thank you for your time.
","""sigsegv often arises when you try to access a protected area of memory. One possibility could be that the pool type you used in your celery command isn't compatible, --pool=threaded seems to work since it doesn't separate the process. Another reason could be permissions; make sure that the file path you provided is correctly set and that all files have read-write permissions. It's also possible that you're running this on a virtual machine with insufficient CPU cores, which can cause memory access issues. Lastly, check if there's an issue with your system Python version conflicting with Celery.""",,"sigsegv often comes when you try to access memory that's not accessible by your program, see here. I could re-create the code and it worked completely fine on my end. Here are the probable reasons why this happened to you:

The pool type you specified in your celery command didn't workout successfully, --pool=solo seems to work since it doesn't fork the process.
Part of the code is executed as root and other parts aren't.
The file path you provided isn't correct, or it exists with wrong permissions.
Maybe you're executing this on a virtual machine with very limited ram, thus no memory is available since the AI model and libraries you've loaded are already heavy?
There's an actual problem with libc on your machine or Celery itself, but the problem isn't clear.

You can run the Celery command with different arguments, such as changing pool from solo to gevent. --pool=solo seems to work fine.

Make sure all files have correct permissions.

how to perform stratified 10 fold cross validation for classification in matlab,"My implementation of usual K-fold cross-validation is pretty much like:

feature selection using bootstrap resampling lasso and stepwise regression,"In this paper, the authors perform radiomics feature selection for survival prediction by:

Bootstrap resampling the dataset x 1000
Fitting cross-validated LASSO models to each the resampled data sets
Retaining the 10 most common features with non-zero coefficients across all 1000 models
Fitting reverse stepwise regression using the ten selected features to the resampled datasets ( the same data sets as generated in step 1)
Choosing the final features based on the most common cox-regression model.

I would like to replicate this approach (albiet for logistic regression rather than cox-regression).
I am able to use the following R code to obtain the top K features from the Lasso models using the 'boot' library:
lasso_Select <- function(x, indices){ 
   x <- x[indices,]
   y <- x$Outcome
   x = subset(x, select = -Outcome)
   x2 <- as.matrix(x)
   fit <- glmnet(x2, y , family=""binomial"",alpha=1, standardize=TRUE)
   cv <- cv.glmnet(x2, y, family=""binomial"",alpha=1,  standardize=TRUE)
   fit <- glmnet(x2, y, family=""binomial"",alpha=1, lambda=cv$lambda.min,  standardize=TRUE)
     return(coef(fit)[,1])
   }

myBootstrap <- boot(scaled_train, lasso_Select, R = 1000, parallel = ""multicore"", ncpus=5)

However, I don't believe I can access the individual resampled datasets to then run the multiple logistic regression models and choose the most common.
Any advice on how to approach this?
","""As the manual page for boot() explains:",,"For most of the boot methods the resampling is done in the worker process, but not if simple = FALSE nor sim = ""non-parametric"".","As the manual page for boot() explains:

For most of the boot methods the resampling is done in the master process, but not if simple = TRUE nor sim = ""parametric"".

As you are not doing parametric bootstrapping and you don't need to specify simple = TRUE, the code displayed when you type boot::boot at the R prompt  shows how the resampled data indices are generated. The critical code is:
if (!simple) 
            i <- index.array(n, R, sim, strata, m, L, weights)

where n is the number of data rows, R is the number of bootstrap samples, and the other arguments are defined in the call to boot() and don't seem to apply to your situation. Typing boot:::index.array shows the code for that function, which in turn calls boot:::ordinary.array for your situation. In your situation, i is just a matrix showing which data rows to use for each bootstrap sample.
It should be reasonably straightforward to tweak the code for boot() to return that matrix of indices along with the other values the function normally returns.
An alternative might be to return indices directly in your lasso_Select() function, although I'm not sure how well the boot() function would handle that.

the analogue of torchautograd in tensorflow,"I want to get the dradients of the model after its training. For exmaple, I have the input tensor X and the output y, that is y = model(x). So using pytorch I can calculate the dradient with the folowing command:
y = model(x)
dydx = torch.autograd.grad(Y, X, torch.ones_like(Y), create_graph=True)[0][:, 0]

I want to get the same value after training model with TensorFlow framework.
I tried:
y = model.predict_u(x)
dydx = tf.gradients(y, x)[0]

But I got dydx as NoneType. I tried to include the dydx in the model class and to get the gradient through the tf.Session but I had: ""ResourceExhaustedError: Graph execution error"".
I have worked with Pytorch framework and now I decide to try TensorFlow, but I have some difficulties.
","To calculate gradients in TensorFlow similar to how you did it in PyTorch, you'll need to use TensorFlow's automatic differentiation capabilities. However, there are a few key differences to keep in mind:

TensorFlow 2.x uses eager execution by default, which is more similar
to PyTorch's dynamic graph approach.
You'll need to use    tf.GradientTape to record operations for
automatic differentiation.

Here's how you can calculate gradients in TensorFlow 2.x, similar to your PyTorch example:
import tensorflow as tf

# Assuming x is your input tensor and model is your TensorFlow model
x = tf.Variable(x)  # Make sure x is a Variable or use tf.convert_to_tensor(x)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y = model(x)
    
dydx = tape.gradient(y, x)

More on the subject:
https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/autodiff
https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/GradientTape
UPD: there is also may be a problem with x
dydx is None: This usually happens because TensorFlow doesn't know it needs to compute gradients with respect to x. By default, only tf.Variable objects are watched. By using tape.watch(x), you explicitly tell TensorFlow to track x.
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume x_value is your input data as a NumPy array or TensorFlow tensor
x_value = ...  # Your input data
x = tf.convert_to_tensor(x_value)  # Convert to a TensorFlow tensor if not already one

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch(x)  # Ensure x is being tracked for gradient computation
    y = model(x)   # Forward pass through your model

# Compute the gradient of y with respect to x
dydx = tape.gradient(y, x)

sklearn randomizedsearchcv extract confusion matrix for different folds,"I try to calculate an aggregated confusion matrix to evaluate my model:
cv_results = cross_validate(estimator, dataset.data, dataset.target, scoring=scoring,
                cv=Config.CROSS_VALIDATION_FOLDS, n_jobs=N_CPUS, return_train_score=False)

But I don't know how to extract the single confusion matrices of the different folds. In a scorer I can compute it:
scoring = {
'cm': make_scorer(confusion_matrix)
}

, but I cannot return the comfusion matrix, because it has to return a number instead of an array. If I try it I get the following error: 
ValueError: scoring must return a number, got [[...]] (<class 'numpy.ndarray'>) instead. (scorer=cm)

I wonder if it is possible to store the confusion matrices in a global variable, but had no success using
global cm_list
cm_list.append(confusion_matrix(y_true,y_pred))

in a custom scorer.
Thanks in advance for any advice.

sklearn get distance from point to nearest cluster,"I'm using clustering algorithms like DBSCAN.
It returns a 'cluster' called -1 which are points that are not part of any cluster. For these points I want to determine the distance from it to the nearest cluster to get something like a metric for how abnormal this point is. Is this possible? Or are there any alternatives for this kind of metric?
",from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import pairwise_distances,"The answer will depend on the linkage strategy you choose. I'll give the example of single linkage.
First, you can construct the distance matrix of your data.

Then, you'll extract the nearest cluster:

        distance = dist_matrix[point, cluster].min()  # Single linkage
        distances.append(distance)

EDIT: This works, but it's O(n^2) as noted by Anony-Mousse. Considering core points is a better idea because it cuts down on your work. In addition, it is somewhat similar to centroid linkage.

how to make a dataloader with a directory of subfolders relevant to each class in pytorch,"I have a dataset that contains images of brain tumoursl. I want to make a CNN to classify these images.What I have seen is a directory of images which is separated in “train” , “test” folders.

|_____no_tumor

Now, I want to make 3 dataloaders. ( a train_dataloader,a validation_dataloader & a test_dataloader.)
Does anyone know how to do this in PyTorch without writing a custom script.
","You can use torchvision's ImageFolder class (docs here), but you should first split your data to train/test/val in separate directories beforehand in this format:
├── train
│   ├── class1
|      ├── image-1.jpg
│      ├── image-2.jpg
│   ├── class2
|      ├── image-1.jpg

│   ├── class2
|      ├── image-1.jpg
│      ├── image-2.jpg
├── test
│   ├── ...
...

to split the images randomly:
import os
import shutil
import random

test_split = 0.2
valid_split = 0.2

if not os.path.exists('./new_dataset_dir'):
    os.mkdir('./new_dataset_dir')

os.mkdir('./new_dataset_dir/test')
os.mkdir('./new_dataset_dir/train')
os.mkdir('./new_dataset_dir/valid')

classes = os.listdir('./dataset_dir')

for c in classes:
    images = os.listdir('./dataset_dir/' + c)
    random.shuffle(images) # optional

    num_images = len(images)
    num_test = int(test_split * num_images)
    num_valid = int(valid_split * num_images)
    num_train = num_images - num_test - num_valid

    os.mkdir('./new_dataset_dir/test/' + c)
    os.mkdir('./new_dataset_dir/train/' + c)
    os.mkdir('./new_dataset_dir/valid/' + c)

    for idx, image in enumerate(images):
        split = 'train' if idx < num_train else 'valid' if idx < num_train + num_valid else 'test'
        shutil.move(f'./dataset_dir/{c}/{image}', f'./new_dataset_dir/{split}/{c}/{image}')
    
    os.rmdir('./dataset_dir/' + c)

Then you can easily create the dataloaders using ImageFolder:
from torchvision.datasets import ImageFolder
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

train_dataset = ImageFolder(root='./new_dataset_dir/train')
val_dataset = ImageFolder(root='./new_dataset_dir/valid')
test_dataset = ImageFolder(root='./new_dataset_dir/test')

train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, ...)
valid_loader = DataLoader(val_dataset, ...)
test_loader = DataLoader(test_dataset, ...)

generate array of positive integers that sum of to k,"My task is simple: I want to generate an (ideally numpy) array containing all combinations of m positive (>=0), but bounded (<= e) integers that sum exactly to k. Note that k and m might be relatively high, so generating all combinations and filtering will not work.
I have implemented it in plain, recursive python but this small functions takes most of my time and I need to replace it to perform better. I have tried to come up with numpy/pytorch code to generate this array but I didn't manage to do it so far.
I currently use numpy and pytorch in my project, but I am open to other libraries as long as I write python code and I get something I can convert to numpy arrays in the end.

","One thing to notice is your function generates redundant outputs. ie get_summing_up_to(30, 30, 8) would contain (30, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), (0, 30, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), ....
One way to make this more efficient is to generate unique integer combinations excluding 0s from 1 to max_length. We can also add caching to the sub-problem of generating partitions for added efficiency.

If the full output with redundant results is required, we can generate them after the fact using the minimal set of outputs from get_summing_up_to_minimal:
from itertools import permutations

def expand_partitions(compact_partitions, max_length):
    result = []
    
    for partition in compact_partitions:
        # Calculate how many zeros we need to add
        zeros_needed = max_length - len(partition)
        if zeros_needed < 0:
            continue
            
        # Create the full partition with zeros
        full_partition = partition + (0,) * zeros_needed
        
        # Generate all unique permutations
        # Using a set to handle cases where partition contains duplicate numbers
        result.extend(set(permutations(full_partition)))
    
    return result

Note that expanding partitions would be the bulk of compute time.
I profiled the following:
# run 1, your original code
out = get_summing_up_to(30, 60, 6)

# run 2, generating just minimal outputs
out = get_summing_up_to_minimal(30, 60, 6)

# run 3, generate minimal outputs and expand to full outputs
out = get_summing_up_to_minimal(30, 60, 6)
out = expand_partitions(out, 8)

On my machine, your original code takes ~4.6 seconds. Generating the minimal outputs takes ~17.9 milliseconds. Generating the minimal outputs and expanding takes ~1.1 seconds.
If your downstream use case doesn't require the redundant combinations, you can save a lot of time just generating the minimal set. If you need to pack the outputs into a numpy array/torch tensor (requiring everything be the same length), you can pad the minimal outputs to max_length with zeros without generating all the combinations. ie:
out = get_summing_up_to_minimal(30, 60, 6)
out_array = np.zeros((len(out), 6))

for i, o in enumerate(out):
    out_array[i][:len(o)] = sorted(o)

",,```python,"One thing to notice is your function generates redundant outputs. For instance, get_summing_up_to(30, 30, 8) would contain (30, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) and (0, 30, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0). To make this more efficient, you should generate distinct combinations using numbers from 0 to the max_length. Adding a memoization step could help in accelerating the sub-problems.

python  lightgbm with gridsearchcv is running forever,"Recently, I am doing multiple experiments to compare Python XgBoost and LightGBM. It seems that this LightGBM is a new algorithm that people say it works better than XGBoost in both speed and accuracy.
This is LightGBM GitHub.
This is LightGBM python API documents, here you will find python functions you can call. It can be directly called from LightGBM model and also can be called by LightGBM scikit-learn.
This is the XGBoost Python API I use. As you can see, it has very similar data structure as LightGBM python API above.
Here are what I tried:

If you use train() method in both XGBoost and LightGBM, yes lightGBM works faster and has higher accuracy. But this method, doesn't have cross validation.
If you try cv() method in both algorithms, it is for cross validation. However, I didn't find a way to use it return a set of optimum parameters.
if you try scikit-learn GridSearchCV() with LGBMClassifier and XGBClassifer. It works for XGBClassifer, but for LGBClassifier, it is running forever.

Here are my code examples when using GridSearchCV() with both classifiers:
XGBClassifier with GridSearchCV
param_set = {
 'n_estimators':[50, 100, 500, 1000]
}
gsearch = GridSearchCV(estimator = XGBClassifier( learning_rate =0.1, 
n_estimators=100, max_depth=5,
min_child_weight=1, gamma=0, subsample=0.8, colsample_bytree=0.8, 
nthread=7,
objective= 'binary:logistic', scale_pos_weight=1, seed=410), 
param_grid = param_set, scoring='roc_auc',n_jobs=7,iid=False, cv=10)

xgb_model2 = gsearch.fit(features_train, label_train)
xgb_model2.grid_scores_, xgb_model2.best_params_, xgb_model2.best_score_

This works very well for XGBoost, and only tool a few seconds.
LightGBM with GridSearchCV
param_set = {
 'n_estimators':[20, 50]
}

gsearch = GridSearchCV(estimator = LGBMClassifier( boosting_type='gbdt', num_leaves=30, max_depth=5, learning_rate=0.1, n_estimators=50, max_bin=225, 
 subsample_for_bin=0.8, objective=None, min_split_gain=0, 
 min_child_weight=5, 
 min_child_samples=10, subsample=1, subsample_freq=1, 
colsample_bytree=1, 
reg_alpha=1, reg_lambda=0, seed=410, nthread=7, silent=True), 
param_grid = param_set, scoring='roc_auc',n_jobs=7,iid=False, cv=10)

lgb_model2 = gsearch.fit(features_train, label_train)
lgb_model2.grid_scores_, lgb_model2.best_params_, lgb_model2.best_score_

However, by using this method for LightGBM, it has been running the whole morning today still nothing generated.
I am using the same dataset, a dataset contains 30000 records.
I have 2 questions:

If we just use cv() method, is there anyway to tune optimum set of parameters?
Do you know why GridSearchCV() does not work well with LightGBM? I'm wondering whether this only happens on me all it happened on others to?

While the scikit package contains a various modules as the machine learning algorithm, most of them specialize in the classification algorithm. I think the classification algorithm certainly satisfy your demand if your date is not identified as the type of time series. Actually, scikit also has some regression module, even though I think that seem not to be well suitable for prediction of time series data.
In the case of prediction of time series data, RNN or LSTM algorithm (Deep Learning) has been widely utilized, but scikit does not provide the build-in algorithm of it.
