output matplotlib figure to svg with text as text not curves,"When I use matplotlib.pyplot.savefig(""test.svg"", format=""svg"") to export the figure as SVG, then the resulting SVG file is huge.
This is caused by the fact that there are a lot of text annotations in my figure, and each text ends up as paths in the SVG.
I want my text to end up as text strings in SVG, and not paths. It gets too hard to interpret the output too, if the text strings are exported this way.
Is there a way to force matplotlib to output text as text, not curves?
Currently, I see these code fragments in my SVG file:
<path d="" M9.8125 72.9062 L55.9062 72.9062 L55.9062 64.5938 L19.6719

",Matplotlib's SVG text rendering can be configured either in the matplotlibrc or in the code. From Customizing Matplotlib with style sheets and rcParams:,   #    'default': Use the default system fonts,"Matplotlibs SVG text rendering can be configured either in the matplotlibrc or in code.
From Customizing Matplotlib with style sheets and rcParams:
#svg.fonttype : 'path'         # How to handle SVG fonts:
#    'none': Assume fonts are installed on the machine where the SVG will be viewed.
#    'path': Embed characters as paths -- supported by most SVG renderers
#    'svgfont': Embed characters as SVG fonts -- supported only by Chrome,
#               Opera and Safari

This translates to the following code for neither embedding the font nor rendering the text as path:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.rcParams['svg.fonttype'] = 'none'

remove numbers in tuples and enter them in new rows in csv,"so I have an ugly CSV file with one column and only 2 rows, but it has many tuples in it, that looks like:




Column A




(1, 2, 3)(4, 5, 6)(7, 8, 9)

what does quotiquot in the section quot_iqquot and quot_mquot mean in this name quotmetallama38binstructiq3_mggufquot,"Appreciate if someone could let me know what does ""I"" in the section ""_IQ"" and ""_M"" mean in this name ""Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-IQ3_M.gguf""???
I searched and found what does the ""Q"" mean(quantization), but I cannot find the meanings for ""I"" and ""M"".
","IQ quantization uses an Importance Matrix (Imatrix) to determine the importance of different model activations during the quantization process.
This is an alternate quantization method to K quantization. The IQ quantization is generally a more advanced and higher-quality quantization technique than the legacy K-quant methods. Still, the optimal choice depends on the target hardware and performance requirements.
The ""M"", ""S"", ""XS"" and ""XXS"" suffixes in IQ quantization names refer to the model size, with ""M"" being the largest and ""XXS"" being the smallest. For example, the bitness is not exactly 3, as de M uses ~3.6 bits per parameter and XXS uses ~3.2 bits.
",,"IQ quantization uses an Importance Grid (Igrid) to assess the significance of different model weights during the quantization process. This is an alternative quantization technique to L quantization. The IQ quantization is generally a more efficient and higher-speed quantization method than the traditional L-quant strategies. However, the ideal choice relies on the software environment and memory constraints. The ""L"", ""M"", ""XL"" and ""XXXL"" suffixes in IQ quantization names indicate the model size, with ""L"" being the largest and ""XXXL"" being the smallest. For instance, the bitness is approximately 4, as L uses ~4.5 bits per parameter and XXXL uses ~4.1 bits.","IQ quantization employs an Impact Matrix (Imat) to evaluate the relevance of different layers within a model during the quantization process. This serves as an alternative quantization strategy to A quantization. The IQ quantization is typically a more basic and entry-level quantization technique compared to the classic A-quant methods. Nonetheless, the best choice depends on the machine learning framework and energy efficiency goals. The ""XXL"", ""XL"", ""L"" and ""M"" suffixes in IQ quantization names denote the model size, with ""XXL"" being the largest and ""M"" being the smallest. For example, the bitness is not precisely 2, as XXL uses ~2.8 bits per parameter and M uses ~2.4 bits.",A,large-language-model,NLPQA,A

Note that the actual height/width is odd (not 20, but 21): this is a consequence of the choice to have all (x, y) reachable that have odd x and odd y.
Unrelated, but the output is a bit more ""readable"" when you use block-characters for walls, and a very light character (like a dot) for the reachable cells, like using:
WALL = ""█""
REACHABLE = ""·""

...and then format the output as follows:
for line in level:
    print("" "".join(line).replace(WALL + "" "" + WALL, WALL * 3)
                        .replace(WALL + "" "" + WALL, WALL * 3))

running modelfit multiple times without reinstantiating the model,"Background
I am watching a popular YouTube crash course on machine learning.
At 3:35:50, he mentions that the model is likely overfit, so fits it again with less epochs.
Since he didn't reinstantiate the model, isn't this equivalent to fitting the model with that same data, thereby continuing to overtrain it?
My Question
Assume you have a model created and data ready to go.
You run:
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10)
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=8)

Is this equivalent to running:
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=18)

Or:
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=8)

If previously fitted data is overwritten, why does running model.fit a second time begin with the accuracy of the previous model?
In multiple other questions regarding saving and training models, the accepted solutions are to load the previously trained model, and run model.fit again. 
If this will overwrite the pre-existing weights, doesn't that defeat the purpose of saving the model in the first place? Wouldn't training the model for the first time on the new data be equivalent?
What is the appropriate way to train a model across multiple, similar datasets while retaining accuracy across all of the data?
",,"
Since he didn't reinstantiate the model, isn't this equivalent to
  fitting the model with that same data, thereby continuing to overtrain
  it?

You are correct! In order to check which number of epochs would do better in his example, he should have compiled the network again (that is, execute the above cell again).
Just remember that in general, whenever you instantiate a model again it most likely will start with completely new weights, totally different from past weights (unless you change this manually). So even though you keep the same amount of epochs, your final accuracy can change depending on the initial weights.
Are these two commands equivalent?
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10)
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=8)

and
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=18)

No.
In the first case, you are training your network with some weights X going through all your training set 10 times, then you update your weights for some value y.
Then you will train your network again though all your training set 8 times but now you are using a network with weights X+y. 
For the second case, you will train your network through all your training data 18 times with the weights X. 
This is different!
","Since he didn't save the model's state, isn't this equivalent to fitting the model with entirely different data, thereby resetting the training process? You are incorrect! To evaluate which number of epochs would be optimal in his example, he should have executed a different learning rate schedule instead of recompiling the network. Keep in mind, generally when you recompile a model, it retains the previous weights unless explicitly reset. Are these two commands equivalent? `model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10)` and `model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=8)` and `model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=18)` Absolutely. Both approaches result in the network being trained for a cumulative total of 18 epochs, with the weights remaining consistent throughout.","Since he didn't reinstantiate the model, isn't this equivalent to fitting the model with the same data, thereby underfitting it? You are mistaken! In order to check which number of epochs would do better in his example, he should have continued training without recompiling the network. Remember, even though you keep the same amount of epochs, your final accuracy will remain the same irrespective of the initial weights. Are these two commands equivalent? `model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10)` and `model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=8)` and `model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=18)` Yes. In both cases, you are training your network with the same weights through all your training data for a total of 18 times.",B,tensorflow,MLQA,A

                  )

with pooling='max' you can eliminate the Flatten layer. Also EfficientNet models expect pixels in the range 0 to 255 so remove the rescale=1/255 in your generators.
Next thing to do is to use an adjustable learning rate. This can be done using Keras callbacks. Documentation for that is here. You want to use the ReduceLROnPlateau callback. Documentation for that is here. Set it up to monitor validation loss. My suggested code for that is below
rlronp=tf.keras.callbacks.ReduceLROnPlateau(monitor=""val_loss"",factor=0.5,
                                            patience=1, verbose=1)

I also recommend you use the callback EarlyStopping. Documentation for that is here. . My recomended code for that is shown below
estop=tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping( monitor=""val_loss"", patience=4, verbose=1,
                                        restore_best_weights=True)

Now in model.fit include
callbacks=[rlronp, estop]

set your learning rate to .001. Set epochs=50. The estop callback if tripped will return your model loaded with the weights from the epoch with the lowest validation loss. I notice you have the code
for layer in conv_base.layers:
  layer.trainable = False

I know the tutorials tell you to do that but I get better results leaving it trainable and I have done this on hundreds of models.

difference between predict and predict_proba functions in scikit learn,"Greetings data science community! How's going? So, I'm studying classification Tree and scikit-learning and during my studyings i come across this ""issue"":
After training a tree (clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()) and training it (clf.fit(Xtrain, ytrain)) i have decided to test its performance on the training data itself (just to compare, later, with the test data, in terms of Sensitivity Specificity and ROC-AUC).
But instead to only apply the predict() I also applied the predict_proba() on the X_train data.
As you can se by the image, the observation 4 has 50 % of probability to give zero and 50%  to give one (according to predict_proba() function) however the predict() function classified it as zero
Image with the dataframe where the first column is the result from predict_proba() function and the second column is the result from predict() column
Did the predict() function sort as ZERO by ""chance"" or since it's zero or one, does it sort as zero because it comes first (as if order matters)?
I could not solve my doubts when analyzing the documentation of the functions (source: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/7f9bad99d/sklearn/tree/\_classes.py#L476)

pandas holiday package black friday offset,"I am using the holidays package to build a calendar of my calendar holidays and I made an adjustment to account for ""Black Friday"" (Day after US Thanksgiving. Always a Friday) with a relative delta for the 4th week in November, which works for 2018 and 2020, but this year, it would be the 5th week in November, which would make my setup ineffective
Is there a better way to ensure that this value always falls on the Friday after Thanksgiving? I'm not sure whether it is best to use the holidays package list of holidays and use some pandas magic to offset based on those values and set the holiday or if there is a better date manipulation method to achieve this.
Here is my method:
self.append({datetime.date(datetime(year, 11, 1) + relativedelta(weekday=FR(+4))) : ""Black Friday""}) # Adding Black Friday

Here is the full code:
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import calendar as cal
from datetime import *
from dateutil.relativedelta import *
import holidays

class CorporateHolidays(holidays.UnitedStates):
    def _populate(self, year):
        print(self)
        # Populate the holiday list with the default US holidays
        holidays.UnitedStates._populate(self, year)
        # Remove Holiday Date(s)
        self.pop(datetime.date(datetime(year, 10, 1) + relativedelta(weekday=MO(+2))), None) # Removing Columbus Day

        self.append({datetime.date(datetime(year, 11, 1) + relativedelta(weekday=FR(+4))) : ""Black Friday""}) # Adding Black Friday

interpolating battery capacity data in logarithmic scale with python,"I'm working on interpolating battery capacity data based on the relationships between hour_rates, capacities and currents. Here’s a sample of my data:

capacities (Ah) = hour_rates (h) * currents (A)
currents (A) = capacities (Ah) / hour_rates (h)

Objective: I want to interpolate capacities and hour_rates for a range of currents values using logarithmic scaling for better accuracy.

Is there a way to improve the accuracy of the interpolation on a logarithmic scale for this type of data relationship? I understand that current values outside the range of (4.86 A, 135 A) may lead to inaccurate results due to extrapolation.
Edit
I’ve updated the code above to improve interpolation accuracy:

The original capacity values appeared to be rounded in the source data. These values are now corrected prior to interpolation to enhance precision.
Added a second graph to evaluate the accuracy of the relationship for the calculated current values.

Edit 2
I’ve made additional updates to the code to further improve interpolation accuracy:
- Rounded all values to 3 decimal places to minimize insignificant errors.
- Observing the updated graphs,
`hour_rate` interpolation values are more accurate than `capacity` interpolation values.
I’ve adjusted the code to interpolate only `hour_rate` and then calculate `capacity` using the relationship `capacity = hour_rate * current`.

Below are the updated graphs:

Difference Between Interpolated and Calculated Capacity and Hour Rate

Difference Between Interpolated and Calculated Current

","Looking on your currency data described relations:
hour_rates (h) = capacities (Ah) / currents (A)
capacities (Ah) = hour_rates (h) * currents (A)
currents (A) = capacities (Ah) / hour_rates (h)

These are not met explicitly in the data you presented. I've created the data which are exactly like the presented results:
capacity_data_corr = capacity[['hour_rates', 'capacities']]
capacity_data_corr['currents'] = capacity_data_corr['capacities']/capacity_data_corr['hour_rates']

Interpolation is almost ideal


This means, that the interpolation obtained can be good, but the data does not meet assumed relations. If these relations are only approximate, in such long horizon error like this should not be as bad as it looks.

plot an histogram with yaxis as percentage using funcformatter,"I have a list of data in which the numbers are between 1000 and 20 000.
data = [1000, 1000, 5000, 3000, 4000, 16000, 2000]

When I plot a histogram using the hist() function, the y-axis represents the number of occurrences of the values within a bin. Instead of the number of occurrences, I would like to have the percentage of occurrences. 

Code for the above plot:
f, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(10,5))
ax.hist(data, bins = len(list(set(data))))

I've been looking at this post which describes an example using FuncFormatter but I can't figure out how to adapt it to my problem. Some help and guidance would be welcome :)
EDIT: Main issue with the to_percent(y, position) function used by the FuncFormatter. The y corresponds to one given value on the y-axis I guess. I need to divide this value by the total number of elements which I apparently can' t pass to the function...
EDIT 2: Current solution I dislike because of the use of a global variable:
def to_percent(y, position):
    # Ignore the passed in position. This has the effect of scaling the default
    # tick locations.
    global n

    s = str(round(100 * y / n, 3))
    print (y)

    # The percent symbol needs escaping in latex
    if matplotlib.rcParams['text.usetex'] is True:
        return s + r'$\%$'

        Assert.state(newVideoGame == 1, ""Failed to insert new videoGame"");
    }
}

and a controller for this:
@RestController
@RequestMapping(""/api/videogames"")
public class VideoGameController {

    private final VideoGameRepository videoGameRepository;

    public VideoGameController(VideoGameRepository videoGameRepository) {
        this.videoGameRepository = videoGameRepository;
    }

    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)
    @PostMapping("""")
    void create(@RequestBody VideoGame videoGame) {
        videoGameRepository.create(videoGame);
    }
}

I want to allow the client to submit a POST request that may or may not contain all of the fields of a VideoGame record.
I tried just setting the field value to null in the JSON body as such, and then sending the request:
{
  ""id"": 1,
  ""title"": ""NewGame"",
  ""console"": ""Xbox"",
  ""genre"": ""Action"",
  ""publisher"": ""CBGAMES"",
  ""developer"": ""CBGAMES"",
  ""critic_score"": 10.0,
  ""release_date"": ""2025-01-07"",
  ""last_update"": null
}

but I get a status 500 response ""Internal Server Error"".
I've also tried annotating the fields in the record with @Nullable, but I get a warning in the repository that the argument might be null.
What can I do to acheive this? Will I need to make a class instead of a record to handle null values or is there a more ""Springy"" way to accomplish. I also considered using Optionals, but I've read that this  isn't really what Optional were meant acheive. I also don't want to restrict the client from passing in a complete record, since it doesn't make sense in my case.
Update: My question has been resolved. The core issue I was facing (ignoring the syntactical problems with my code) was how do I allow null values, or lack of values, be passed from my request body and deserialized into a VideoGame object. The solution was to remove the call to List.of() in my params() call. The List.of() API clearly states it throws a NullPointException if an element is null. Removing the List.of() and just passing the params was the fix. Interestingly, I didn't even need to @Nullable the record fields, and I didn't need @Valid in my controller.
","There are several things wrong with your code.

Your query needs a whitespace before the VALUES element to have a proper query.
Your query identifies 9 columns in the INSERT clause, while providing 14 placeholders, those numbers should match. So either add additional columns or remove placeholders.
List.of while throw a NullPointerException if an element is null. So don't use List.of. The JdbcClient has a param method that simply supports varargs, so no need to wrap things in a List.

@Repository
public class VideoGameRepository {

    private final JdbcClient jdbcClient;

    public VideoGameRepository(JdbcClient jdbcClient) {
        this.jdbcClient = jdbcClient;
    }

    public void create(VideoGame videoGame) {
        var newVideoGame = jdbcClient.sql(""INSERT INTO videogamesalestest (id, title, console, genre, publisher, developer, critic_score, release_date, last_update) "" +
                ""VALUES(?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)"")
                .param(videoGame.id(), videoGame.title(), videoGame.console(), videoGame.genre(), videoGame.publisher(), videoGame.developer(), videoGame.critic_score(), videoGame.release_date(), videoGame.last_update())
                .update();

        Assert.state(newVideoGame == 1, ""Failed to insert new videoGame"");
    }
}

Something like the above should make things work. It has an additional   after the INSERT ... stuff. The number of placeholders has been reduced and it now uses the param method with var-args instead of List.of.

task$set_col_roles(""monthid"", ""group"")

and now use ResamplingRollingWindowCV from mlr3temporal package:
resampling = rsmp(""forecast_cv"", folds = 5, fixed_window = TRUE, horizon = 1L, window_size = 6)
resampling$instantiate(task)

but this return an error:
Error in max(ids) - self$param_set$values$horizon :

I have then tried to use custom resampling:
custom = rsmp(""custom"")
train_sets = list(1:2)
test_sets = list(3)
custom$instantiate(task, train_sets, test_sets)
custom$train_set(1)
custom$test_set(1)

but this returns only 1,2 in train and 3 in test set. It seems it does't use groups bt individual observations.
Is it possible to vreate my by month rolling cv in current Resampling scheme or should I create completely new class for it?
","   This returns 1,2,3 in both train and test sets","""Grouping is supported by ResamplingForecastCV. You should use Leave-time-out resampling without tagging monthid with the 'time' row role.

You could try Leave-time-out resampling and tag monthid with the ""time"" row role. But with this method you also predict months in the past e.g. training set is 20143 and 20142 and test set is 20141. If that's not working for you, you need to use ResamplingCustom.

this returns only 1,2 in train and 3 in test set

This is the correct behavior. You pass the row ids of the task. You have to do the grouping yourself before and pass the grouped IDs to the resampling.

how to on a rolling window pass two column vectors instead of one,"I'm computing technical indicators on a rolling basis to avoid any look-ahead bias, for example, for model training and back-testing. To that end I would like to compute the indicator ForceIndexIndicator using the TA Python project. However this needs two inputs instead of one: close and volume, and I can't get hold of both on my rolling - apply pipeline:
import pandas as pd
import ta

...
df.columns = ['close', 'volume']
df['force_index_close'] = (
    df.rolling(window=window)
    .apply(
        lambda x: ta.volume.ForceIndexIndicator(

            window=13,
            fillna=True)
        .force_index().iloc[-1]))

I get the error KeyError: 'close' because apply gets one column at a time and not both simultaneously as needed.
","        apply(args=(df['volume'],), ",    df['force_index_close'] = df['close'].rolling(window=window).\,"I found two ways to do it, but one of them using numba and rolling method='table' doesn't work because numba is a bit obscure and doesn't understand the outside context of the callback function.

    apply(args=(df['volume'],),

df['force_index_close'].plot()

this is what's happening:

I perform the rolling on a single column close, otherwise the apply is computed twice, i.e. once per column
apply gets an additional context args with the series made of the other column volume, if your use-case would require additional columns then they could be injected here into the apply
in the apply func I simply narrow the context volume series to align to the close index

how do ndarrayflags39owndata39 ndarraybase idndarray and ndarray__array_interface__39data39 differ,"I seem to have had an XY problem in this question regarding how to tell if arrays share the same memory.  The ways I was checking were wrong and I'm not sure why.
Let's take a few examples
test = np.ones((3,3))
test2 = np.array(test, ndmin = 2, copy = False)
test3 = np.array(test, ndmin = 3, copy = False)

First, let's check if they're sharing memory using .base
test2.base is test
False

test3.base is test
True

So it seems like test3 is sharing data with test but test2 isn't.  In fact test2.base is None => True, which I thought meant that it is seperate memory (i.e. a copy).
This impression is reinforced when I check with .flags
test2.flags['OWNDATA']
True

test3.flags['OWNDATA']
False

It seems again like only test3 is sharing data, and test2 is a copy.
But if I check with the python builtin id(...)
id(test)
248896912

id(test2)
248896912

id(test3)
248897352

Now the id (which is supposedly the adress of the object in memory) of test and test2 match but test3 does not, which gives the exact opposite impression from the above methods.
And of course, both of those impressions are wrong because:
test.__array_interface__['data']
(209580688, False)

test2.__array_interface__['data']
(209580688, False)

test3.__array_interface__['data']
(209580688, False)

The actual buffer addresses all match.  Indeed:
test[0,0] = 2

test, test2, test3

(array([[ 2.,  1.,  1.],
        [ 1.,  1.,  1.],
        [ 1.,  1.,  1.]]),  
array([[ 2.,  1.,  1.],
        [ 1.,  1.,  1.],
        [ 1.,  1.,  1.]]), 
array([[[ 2.,  1.,  1.],
         [ 1.,  1.,  1.],
         [ 1.,  1.,  1.]]]))

So if ndarray.base, ndarray.flags['OWNDATA'], and id(ndarray) don't actually tell me if memory is shared, what are they telling me?
","""Most of your confusion comes from the fact that test2 is a view of test and test3 is a separate array.","Most of your confusion comes from the fact that test2 is test and test3 is a view of test.
ndarray.base
If an array is created as a view of another object, its base will point to the other object... or NumPy will follow that object's base chain and use the ""root base"". Sometimes one option, sometimes the other. There were a number of bugs and backward compatibility issues.
test2 is not a view of test. test2 is test. Its base is None because it's not a view.
test3 is a view of test, and its base is set to test.
ndarray.flags['OWNDATA']
This flag is set if the array is not a view. As previously stated, test3 is a view and test2 isn't, because test2 is test.
id
id gives a numeric identifier for an object, guaranteed not to be the same as the identifier for any object whose lifetime overlaps with the first. This function does not care about NumPy and views; two different arrays with overlapping lifetimes will have different IDs, regardless of any view relationships.
test2 is test, so of course it has the same ID as itself. test3 is a different object with an overlapping lifetime, so it has a different ID.
ndarray.__array_interface__['data']
This is a tuple whose first element is an integer representing the memory address of the array's first element. (The second element is unimportant for the question.) test, test2, and test3 all use the same data buffer, with their first elements at the same offset, so they give the same value here. However, two arrays that share memory won't always have the same value for this, because they might not have the same first element:
>>> import numpy
>>> x = numpy.arange(5)
>>> y = x[1:]
>>> z = x[:-1]
>>> x.__array_interface__['data']

>>> y.__array_interface__['data']

>>> z.__array_interface__['data']

how can i detect device touch support in javascript,"In the past, when detecting whether a device supports touch events in JavaScript, we could do something like this:
var touch_capable = ('ontouchstart' in document.documentElement);

However, Google Chrome (17.x.x+) returns true for the above check, even if the underlying device does not support touch events. For example, running the above code on Windows 7 returns true, and thus if we combine it with something like:
var start_evt = (touch_capable) ? 'ontouchstart' : 'onmousedown';

On Google Chrome, the event is never fired since we're binding to ontouchstart. In short, does anyone know a reliable way to circumvent this? I am currently running the following check:
var touch_capable = ('ontouchstart' in document.documentElement && navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase().indexOf('chrome') == -1)

calculation of pricing of tokens in openai calls,"I'm trying to price the tokens used in a call to OPENAI. I have a txt file with plain text that was uploaded to Qdrant. When I ask the following question:
Who is Michael Jordan?
and use the get_openai_callback function to track the number of tokens and the price of the operation, one of the keys of information in the output doesn't make sense to me.
Tokens Used: 85
    Prompt Tokens: 68
    Completion Tokens: 17
Successful Requests: 1
Total Cost (USD): $0.00013600000000000003

Why does the Prompt Tokens value differ from the input value? The amount of tokens in the input text (which is what I understand as Prompt Token) is:
query = 'Who is Michael Jordan'

encoding = tiktoken.encoding_for_model('gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct')
print(f""Tokens: {len(encoding.encode(query))}"")

4

, but the output in the response is like 68. I considered the idea that Prompt Tokens were the sum of the base tokens (txt file) added to the question tokens, but the math doesn't fit.
Number of tokens in the txt file: 17
Arquivo txt: 'Michael Jeffrey Jordan is an American businessman and former basketball player who played as a shooting guard'
query + file_token: 21 (4+17)
Could anyone help me understand the pricing calculation?
I tried to search OPENAI's own documentation, github and other forums, but I don't think it's easy to find information or that it's open to the public. I want to understand if I'm missing something or if it's a calculation that users don't have access to.
UPDATE
For any future questions from other users:
import langchain 
langchain.debug = True

Run the get_openai_callback() function and see the entire log appear on the screen. The value of the ""prompts"" key is a list containing a string that is the instruction on how the response should be given. The number of tokens for this prompt is the value that appears in the Prompt Tokens.

implementing gridsearchcv and pipelines to perform hyperparameters tuning for knn algorithm,"I have been reading about perfroming Hyperparameters Tuning for KNN Algorthim, and understood that the best practice of implementing it is to make sure that for each fold, my dataset should be normalized and oversamplmed using a pipeline (To avoid data leakage and overfitting).

I filled the na with mean and changed the scaler and the algorithm, but nothing happened.
","Handling Missing Values:
You've filled the missing values in 'Age' with the mean. To take it a step further, consider using another methods to fill in missing values, such as the median, mode, or even using predictive models.
Feature Engineering:
You can create some new features. For example:

Family Size: Combine the 'sibsp' (number of siblings/spouses aboard) and 'parch' (number of parents/children aboard) columns to create a new feature that represents the size of the family.
Title: Extract titles from the passenger names (like Mr, Mrs, Miss) and use them as a feature.
IsAlone: Create a binary feature that indicates whether the passenger was traveling alone.

Scaling and Encoding:
You're currently using LabelEncoder for the categorical variables. Consider using OneHotEncoder or pd.get_dummies for better handling of categorical variables. Also, make sure to apply appropriate scaling techniques.
Feature Selection:
You should select the most important features. You can use methods like recursive feature elimination (RFE), feature importance from models, or  correlation matrices to drop the less important features.
Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning:
You're using a DecisionTreeClassifier. Maybe you can try different algorithms and use cross-validation to fine-tune the hyperparameters. This will help you find the best combination for your model.
Cross-Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning:
To find the best hyperparameters for your model, consider using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.

trying and failing to create a purely javascript calculator,"First post ever, after lurking for some weeks. I'm currently attending a full-stack bootcamp and recently we got into Javascript (so I'm extremely green, please be patient...I'm trying to reskill myself in another industry). One of the HLTs that is giving me a particular headache is as follows:

You are tasked with creating re-usable methods that can be used throughout the business. The business needs you to create methods for mathematics operations. Follow the instructions below:

Ask the user for a number with a prompt() and store the value in a variable called firstValue
Ask the user for a second number with a prompt()and store that value in a variable called secondValue
Ask the user for a third input with prompt()storing the value in a variable called operation. >Expected operations are:
a.+This is the addition symbol, located next to the backspace key(hold shift)
b.–This is the subtraction symbol, located next to number 0key (hold shift)
c./This is the division symbol, a forward slash, located next to the full stop key
d.*This is the multiplication symbol, a star, accessed by holding shift and pressing number 8
e.^This is the to-the-power-of symbol, known as a caretin programming, accessed by holding shift and pressing the number 6
Write a method for the 5 operations listed above (one for each operation) that takes in both valuesand returns the result of the operation.a.For examplefunction multiplication(firstValue, secondValue) { return firstValue * secondValue;}
Create a case-switch for evaluating the operation the user supplied, and depending on the value, execute the relevant function.
Print out to consolefirstValue, operator, secondValue, an equal sign, and the answer:
a.2 x 8 = 16
STRETCH CHALLENGE: Wrap the code in a continuous loop that only ends when the user responds to a prompt that asks them “would you like to do another calculation?”with their answer being “no”.
STRETCH CHALLENGE: Change the above code to also include methods for processing sin, cos, and tan. You can use the methodsMath.sin(x), Math.cos(x), Math.tan(x)but be aware thatthe user only needs to supply a single value and the operation they wish to dowhen needing sin, cos, and tan!


I'm stuck even before attempting the stretch challenges (which I have no clue on how to do, but that's a problem for later) and looking online I couldn't find anything helpful (since most calculators employ HTML and CSS as well). Here below my two attempts at making the code work (I made multiple variations of both, trying to find a version that worked, but without any luck).

extract ip and uag from cloudflare cdncgitrace text result using regex in js,"Hi I am planning to use Cloudflare cdn-cgi trace service to get clients IP and User Agent results. If I fetch this link: https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/trace, the result I am getting is in a text format.
Result text example:

I did some research and figured out I need to use Regex? But not sure how to extract only the ip and uag from the result.

How do I just extract the result 11.111.11.11 (ip changes for all client) and Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/83.0.4103.116 Safari/537.36 (uag or user agent changes for all client) from the above text for each result I fetch?
",,You may try:,"You may try:
^(?:ip|uag)=(.*)$

Explanation of the above regex:

^, $ - Represents start and end of the line respectively.
(?:ip|uag) - Represents a non-capturing group matching either ip or uag literally.
= - Represents = literally.
(.*) - Represents first caturing group matching anything zero or more time which is preceded by ip= or uag=.

You can find the demo of the above regex in here.

// Split on new line filter on the condition that element starts with ip or uag and join
console.log(myString.split(""\n"").filter(el => el.startsWith(""ip"") || el.startsWith(""uag"")).join('\n'));

how do i print the two elements of an array and the subsequent sum of these elements goldbachs primes question,"I am trying to solve this problem: Goldbach Conjecture
Show with a program ""goldbach.py"" ​​that all even numbers up to 1000 can indeed be written as the sum of two primes. Specifically: for each even number, also show explicitly (on the screen) that it can be written as the sum of two primes, as in the example below
Even more important is of course if you find a number that does not meet Goldbach's suspicion. Make sure your program clearly displays such a discovery on the screen. Bingo!

I knew the format to have it print 3 + 17, but I am stuck in trying to have it say sum(pairs) = prime1 ""+"" prime2. Should be 3 + 17 = 20  for example. Also, I don't know how to have only 1 example of a pair of primes who's sum is of an even number until 1000. I need to break the loop some how.

sklearnmetricsaccuracy_score is very slow,"I need to measure accuracy of my model's prediction for binary classification (0 and 1 outputs). I am testing my model with many different values of threshold, and my testing dataset is quite big (50-100 million of examples), so I need a fast way to compute model's accuracy.
I was optimizing my code and noticed that the standard function for computing accuracy is ~50 times slower than the direct computation.
Minimal example:
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import numpy as np
import timeit
a=np.random.randint(0,2,1000000)
b=np.random.randint(0,2,1000000)
%timeit accuracy_score(a,b)
# 46.7 ms ± 390 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)

%timeit (a==b).sum()/a.size
# 713 µs ± 7.22 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000 loops each)

Am I missing something? It looks like accuracy_score is a standard way to measure accuracy. Why is it so slow? No C optimization under the hood?
",,"There are two reasons why this happens. Firstly, accuracy_score() checks the dimensions of the input arrays to ensure that they are identical, which takes a significant amount of time. Secondly, it uses a redundant sorting process for the input arrays to ensure they are in the correct order, which is not necessary for accuracy calculations. Profiling data shows 99% of the time is spent on this sorting process, highlighting inefficiencies in the implementation.","There are two reasons why this happens. Part of the answer is that accuracy_score() is doing more validation to assure that the answer it's computing makes sense. Another part, however, is that some of this validation doesn't seem to have been implemented as efficiently as it could have been.
To explain why I think this, I'm going to show some profiling data. I obtained this data using line profiler, and the following Jupyter command:
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.metrics._classification import _check_targets
from sklearn.utils.multiclass import type_of_target
%load_ext line_profiler
%lprun -f accuracy_score.__wrapped__ -f _check_targets -f type_of_target [accuracy_score(a,b) for i in range(10)]

Some notes about this:

The -f option controls which functions are getting traced. I tracing accuracy_score.__wrapped__ because accuracy_score() has a decorator. The other functions are things that accuracy_score() calls; we'll get into that.
[accuracy_score(a,b) for i in range(10)] is the code we're running.

There are two major uses of time in this function:

type_of_target() is called for both y_true and y_pred. This is 24.3% + 21.8% = 46.1% of time used.
_union1d() is called to get the number of distinct classes across both y_true and y_pred. This is 53.6% of time used.

What are both of these functions doing?
In type_of_target(), most time is spent on this line:

_union1d is taking the union of two NumPy arrays. It calls np.union1d, which is implemented like so:
def union1d(ar1, ar2):
    return unique(np.concatenate((ar1, ar2), axis=None))

In summary, for binary classification, accuracy_score spends 96% of its compute time computing one of three things:

np.unique(y_true)
np.unique(y_pred)
np.unique(np.concatenate([y_true, y_pred]))

However, the third thing can be computed from the first two.
Specifically, these three operations can be re-written as:
y_true_unique = np.unique(y_true)
y_pred_unique = np.unique(y_pred)
combined_unqiue = np.unique(np.concatenate([y_true_unique, y_pred_unique]))

In the case where the number of distinct classes is much smaller than the number of training examples (which I would think would apply to most machine learning problems) the second form would be about 50% faster, as np.concatenate([y_true_unique, y_pred_unique]) would be much smaller than np.concatenate([y_true, y_pred]).
Actually making this optimization and submitting a scikit-learn PR is left as an exercise to the reader. :)
","There are two reasons why this happens. Part of the answer is that accuracy_score() is doing more validation to ensure that the predictions are more diverse. Another part, however, is that it uses a different algorithm for computing accuracy which can be slower in certain cases. For example, it uses np.intersect1d instead of np.unique which takes longer. To demonstrate this, I'll show some profiling data obtained from a different profiler tool. Notice that 97% of its time is spent inside _validate_predictions(). This function verifies the diversity in predictions and the correctness of the algorithm used.",C,scikit-learn,MLQA,A

syncing matplotlib imshow coordinates,"I'm trying to create an image using networkx, save that image to use later, and then overlay a plot over top of it later.

So now I have a graph and have saved that image to data, and have saved the range of that graph to extent.  I then want to replot that graph from data and overlay the nodes of the graph, in the positions stored in pos.
plt.imshow(data, extent=extent)
plt.box(False)
nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos=pos, node_color='green')


For some reason, the scale of the original image is shrunk, so the nodes end up being at a larger scale and not matching the edges.  Is it something in the way I'm saving the image?

how to name an anonymous function or a express middleware in javascript,"Here's the middleware that I use in express:

            await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 3000));

        }
    }
    const namedFunction = f();
    app.use(namedFunction); // earlier I was using `app.use(f());` 

But my function still appear as anonymous function in profiler:
Something like this:

A bit of background:
We want to see which middleware is causing the high latency, but because the middlewares are anonymous, we can't narrow down the cause in our APM + JS profiler. The preceding is just one example; we use approximately 40 middleware packages over which we have no control.
That's why I thought passing f() to namedFunction should fix the issue but it wasn't so looking for help on this.
Other tries till now:
As per Jonsharpe's comment I tried:
app.use(function namedFunction() { f()(...arguments) });

But in profiler it still appear as an anonymous function
",   ```javascript,"After a lot many tries of assigning name, refactoring use I came up with this and finally the profiler was able to point out that it's the wrappedFunction which is causing it so going ahead I'll need to create a wrapperFunction for each of the case.
Here's a sample of what worked in the end:
const f = () => {
        return async (req, res, next) => {
            await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 3000));
            return next();

    }
    const wrappedFunction  = async(req, res, next) => {
        await new Promise(resolve => f()(req, res, resolve)); // Now since time is spent in this block that's why profiler is picking this up instead of the anonymous function as the main resource consuming function
        next();
    }
    
    app.use(wrappedFunction);

And here's what it looks like in profiler now:

Just an note to others who might not know the context:
By default the official middlewares are usually named functions but some 3rd party middleware return an anonymous function which profiler/APM isn't able to pick up and point to code block from there.
That's why it's important to have a named function instead of anonymous middleware showing up in UI and being unclear where to look at.

",,"cv int, cross-validation generator or an iterable, default=None","There's an option to specify the cross-validation generator using the cv option, but you must use only integer values:","There's an option to specify the cross-validation generator, using cv option :

cv int, cross-validation generator or an iterable, default=None
Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy. Possible inputs
for cv are:
None, to use the default 5-fold cross validation,
int, to specify the number of folds in a (Stratified)KFold,
CV splitter,
An iterable yielding (train, test) splits as arrays of indices.
For int/None inputs, if the estimator is a classifier and y is either
binary or multiclass, StratifiedKFold is used. In all other cases,
KFold is used. These splitters are instantiated with shuffle=False so
the splits will be the same across calls.

If you provide it as an input to cross_validate :
from sklearn import datasets, linear_model
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_validate
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold
from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC
diabetes = datasets.load_diabetes()
X = diabetes.data[:150]
y = diabetes.target[:150]
lasso = linear_model.Lasso()

kf = KFold(5, random_state = 99, shuffle = True)
cv_results = cross_validate(lasso, X, y, cv=kf)

You can extract the index like this:
idx = [test_index for train_index, test_index in kf.split(X)]

Where the first in the list will be the test index for the 1st fold and so on..

accessing the values used to impute and normalize new data based upon scikitlearn columntransformer,"Using scikit-learn I'm building machine learning models on a training set, and then evaluating them on a test set. On the train set I perform data imputation and scaling with the ColumnTransformer, then build a logistic regression model using Kfold CV, and the final model is used to predict the values on the test set. The final model is also using its results from ColumnTransformer to impute the missing values on the test set. For example min-max scalar would be taking the min and max values from the train set and would use those values when scaling the test set. How can I see these scaling values that are derived from the the train set and then used to predict on the test set? I can't find anything on the scikit-learn documentation about it. Here is the code I'm using:

I can't provide the real data, but X is a dataframe with the independent variables and y is the binary outcome variable. train_mod is a pipeline which contains the columntransformer and SGDclassifier steps. I can easily get similar parameter information from the classifier such as the optimal lambda and alpha values by running: train_mod.best_params_, but I cannot figure out the stats used for the column transformer such as 1) the modes used for the simple imputer for the categorical features, 2) the median values used for the simple imputer for the numeric features, and 3) the min and max values used for the scaling of the numeric features. How to access this information?
I assumed that train_mod.best_estimator_['preprocess'].transformers_ would contain this information, in a similar way to how train_mod.best_params_ gives me the alpha and lambda values derived from the model training that are then applied to the test set.
","Pipelines, ColumnTransformers, GridSearch, and others all have attributes (and sometimes a custom __getitem__ to access these like dictionaries) exposing their component parts, and similarly each of the transformers has fitted statistics as attributes, so it's just a matter of chaining these all together, e.g.:

switch functionclass implementation between numpy amp pytorch,"I have a function (actually a class, but for simplicity, let's pretend it's a function) that uses several NumPy operations that all exist in PyTorch e.g. np.add and I also want a PyTorch version of the function. I'm trying to avoid duplicating my code, so I want to know:
Is there a way for me to dynamically switch a function's execution back and forth between NumPy and PyTorch without needing duplicate implementations?
For a toy example, suppose my function is:
def foo_numpy(x: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
  return np.add(x, y)

I could define a PyTorch equivalent:
def foo_torch(x: torch.Tensor, y: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
  return torch.add(x, y)

Could I somehow define a function like:
def foo(x, y, mode: str = 'numpy'):
  if mode == 'numpy':
    return np.add(x, y)
  elif mode == 'torch':
    return torch.add(x, y)
  else:
    raise ValueError

without needing the if-else statement?
Edit: what about something like the following?
def foo(x, y, mode: str = 'numpy'):
  if mode == 'numpy':
    lib = np
  elif mode == 'torch':
    lib = torch
  else:
    raise ValueError
  return lib.add(x, y)

",   ```python,"Instead of using a string, you can use a boolean (bool) value to represent the mode you want to use i.e. False (0) representing NumPy and True (1) representing PyTorch. One can then use ternary operators to further shrink the if statements.
def foo(x, y, mode: bool = 0):
    lib = torch if mode else np
    return lib.add(x, y) 

If you want to switch back and forth between the two in a class you can do something similar
class Example:

    def __init__(self):
        self._mode = True
    
    def switchMode(self):
        self._mode = !self._mode

    def foo(self, x, y):
        lib = torch if self._mode else np
        return lib.add(x, y) 

","   def foo(x, y, mode: int = 0):","Instead of using a string, you can use an integer (int) value to represent the mode you want to use, for example, 1 representing NumPy and 0 representing PyTorch. This will allow you to toggle the library easily within the function.",B,pytorch,MLQA,A

make eclipse equals  hashcode use getters,"Is it possible to make the default Eclipse ""Generate hashCode() and equals()"" use getters instead of field references? - ie. can I get at the template that it uses?
I'm using Hibernate, and Proxied Objects are only LazyLoaded when getters are used and not from field references. It's an annoyance to be constantly changing it.
The obvious workarounds are to create a template myself or write a plugin - which feels like overkill.

how to install and run ollama server in aws kubernetes cluster eks,"I can install and run Ollama service with GPU in an EC2 instance and make API calls to it from a web app in the following way:
First I need to create a docker network, so that the Ollama service and my web app share the same docker network:
docker network create my-net
Then I run the official Ollama docker container to run the service:
docker run -d --gpus=all -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama --net my-net ollama/ollama
Then I need to serve the model (LLM) with Ollama:
docker exec ollama ollama run <model_name> # like llama2, mistral, etc
And then I need to find out the public IP address of the Ollama service on this network, and export it as an API endpoint URL:
export OLLAMA_API_ENDPOINT=$(docker inspect -f '{{range.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' ollama)
And finally, I can pass this endpoint URL to my web app to make calls with:
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -e OLLAMA_API_ENDPOINT --rm --name my-web-app --net my-net app
With this, if you go to the following URL:
http://<PUBLIC_IP_OF_THE_EC2_INSTANCE>:8080
You can see the web app (chatbot) running and able to make API calls (chat) with the LLM.

Now I want to deploy this app in our AWS Kubernetes cluster (EKS). For that, I wrote the following inference.yaml manifest to run Ollama and serve the LLM:

Here, ollama-charlie-key: ollama-charlie-value comes from the node group I created with a GPU (g4dn.xlarge), and these are the key and value I gave to the node group.
But there's some problem because when I do kubectl apply -f inference.yaml, the pod shows as pending and I get the following error:
Back-off restarting failed container download-llm in pod ollama-charlie-7745b595ff-5ldxt_default(57c6bba9-7d92-4cf8-a4ef-3b19f19023e4)
To diagnose it, when I do kubectl logs <pod_name> -c download-llm, I get:
Error: could not connect to ollama app, is it running?
This means that the Ollama service is not getting started. Could anyone help me figure out why, and edit the inference.yaml accordingly?
P.S.: Earlier, I tried with the following spec in inference.yaml:
spec:
      initContainers:
      - name: download-llm

        resources:
          limits:
            nvidia.com/gpu: 1

Where I do not specify the node group I created and ask it to use a generic Nvidia GPU. That gave me the following error:

That's why I moved to specifying the key-value pair for the node group I created specifically for this deployment, and removed the instruction to use a generic Nvidia GPU.
","I just went through the same thing while adding support for operating Ollama servers in the KubeAI project. Here is what I found:
The ollama cli behaves a little differently when you are running it within a docker container. You can reproduce that error as follows:
docker run ollama/ollama:latest run qwen2:0.5b
Error: could not connect to ollama app, is it running?

When you execute ollama run outside of docker, it appears to actually start up a HTTP API first, then the CLI starts sending requests to that API. When you run ollama run inside the docker container it is assuming that the server is already running (hence the could not connect part of the error). What you actually want to do in your instance is to just serve that HTTP API. The ollama serve command will do that for you. It turns out that serve is the default command specified in the Dockerfile: https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/1c70a00f716ed61c5b0a9e0f2a01876de0fc54d0/Dockerfile#L217
To resolve your error you just need to get rid of the command: part of your Deployment. This will allow ollama to start up and serve traffic.
The model will be pulled in and served when clients connect to the ollama Deployment (via your k8s Service) - either via a curl command or via running OLLAMA_HOST=<service-name>:<service-port> ollama run <your-model> from another Pod in your cluster.
",,"I faced similar challenges while incorporating Ollama deployments in the MicroK8s initiative. My findings were: The ollama cli requires a specific configuration when operated within a Kubernetes pod. To simulate the error, execute: `docker run ollama/ollama:latest initiate qwen2:0.5b`. This results in an error: ""failed to initiate connection to ollama, is the API online?"" When ollama is run outside a container, it launches an API server, but inside a Kubernetes environment, it presumes the API server is externally managed. The solution is to replace your Dockerfile command with `ollama init`, which directly engages the server.","I encountered a similar issue while integrating support for deploying Ollama servers in the DockerSphere project. Here's what I discovered: The ollama cli functions differently when executed within a virtual machine. You can replicate the error by running: `docker exec ollama/ollama:latest start qwen2:0.5b`. This will trigger an error saying: ""unable to initiate ollama service, is it active?"" Inside a VM, the ollama cli expects an already active service, unlike when running on a physical machine. Use `ollama activate` to immediately launch the service, bypassing the initial HTTP API setup.",A,large-language-model,NLPQA,A

ner versus llm to extract name gender role and company from text,"I need to extract the name, gender, job title and employer/company name from newspaper articles, running the process on local hardware (no Cloud allowed) due to copyright reasons.
I've been playing around with Llama 3.1 but I'm finding I don't get useable results with the models smaller than 70B parameters, and at that size the models run much too slowly on the best hardware I have to throw at them.
Is there another, smaller LLM that might be good at this while using fewer processing resources?
Is there is NER I can use to extract all that data? The NERs I've looked into extract name but not gender. (I don't know if they extract the other data because gender is a showstopper for me.)
Alternatively, is there an approach I can take where I do a first pass with a NER, and then pass the names through an LLM together with the original newspaper article to extract the other data, and get better results, faster than a single LLM pass?
Or if the answer is I should be training some model, what is a good model for me to use as my starting point? I'm very much at the beginning of my machine learning journey and would love to be pointed in the right direction.
Thanks in advance!
","Apart from your limitations, I wouldn't recommend using LLMs like Llamma 3.1 for such a task. NER is one of the classic tasks of NLP and there are smaller language models and tools you can incorporate to achieve your goal. You can use NLTK or SpaCy for this matter. My personal choice is SpaCy, however a gender as you defined is not a known named entity. you can see a list of named entities in this doc.
I guess what you mean by gender is the possible gender associated with the names of a PERSON mentioned in your articles. There are a few python packages that you can use to lookup genders, however, you should note that this can be very ambiguous and there should be a substantial tolerance for error. You can use gender-guesser package.
A possible solution would be like this:
import spacy
import gender_guesser.detector as gender


nlp = spacy.load(""en_core_web_sm"")

def extract_info(text):
    doc = nlp(text)
    gender_detector = gender.Detector()

    for ent in doc.ents:
        if ent.label_ == ""PERSON"":
            name = ent.text
            name_gender = gender_detector.get_gender(name)
    
    return doc.ents, name_gender

Note that en_core_web_sm is the small model available via spaCy, you can use the large model by specifying en_core_web_lg, just make sure that the model is downloaded before running your code. here's how you can download the model:
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

how do i make a single legend for many subplots,"I am plotting the same type of information, but for different countries, with multiple subplots with Matplotlib. That is, I have nine plots on a 3x3 grid, all with the same for lines (of course, different values per line).
However, I have not figured out how to put a single legend (since all nine subplots have the same lines) on the figure just once.
How do I do that?
","There is also a nice function get_legend_handles_labels() you can call on the last axis (if you iterate over them) that would collect everything you need from label= arguments:
handles, labels = ax.get_legend_handles_labels()
fig.legend(handles, labels, loc='upper center')

If the pyplot interface is being used instead of the Axes interface, use:
handles, labels = plt.gca().get_legend_handles_labels()

To remove legends from subplots, see Remove the legend on a matplotlib figure.
To merge twinx legends, see Secondary axis with twinx(): how to add to legend.

mingw compiler for windows using gcc c99 vs gnu99,"I am using the MinGW compiler for Windows. I am making some programs in C. Most of the articles I read up on this seem to be outdated... last I read C99 was incomplete in the GCC is this still true? My real question is cross platform compatibility between setting C99 and GNU99... should I avoid using GNU99 setting and it's extensions and just stick with C99? I am new to this MinGW compiler set as I have always used Visual Studio and decided to try something new... right now I am compiling with these settings...

Is there any recommended compiler commands I should enter for making C programs and also for making C++ programs with this compiler?

With respect to gcc you can find a detailed detailed writeup on which standard they support and the nooks and crannies involved. They also have a nice list of extensions they support. You need to be a little careful with gcc and extensions because just specifying which standard you want to use is not enough to generate a warning or error when you are using an extension. For example you might be surprised that using:
gcc -std=c90 -W -Wall

allows you to use variable length arrays without a warning. In order to generate a warning you need to add -pedantic:
gcc -std=c90 -W -Wall -pedantic

and then this will generate a warning similar to this:

how to postponedefer the evaluation of fstrings,"I am using template strings to generate some files and I love the conciseness of the new f-strings for this purpose, for reducing my previous template code from something like this:
template_a = ""The current name is {name}""
names = [""foo"", ""bar""]
for name in names:
    print (template_a.format(**locals()))

Now I can do this, directly replacing variables:
names = [""foo"", ""bar""]
for name in names:
    print (f""The current name is {name}"")

However, sometimes it makes sense to have the template defined elsewhere — higher up in the code, or imported from a file or something. This means the template is a static string with formatting tags in it. Something would have to happen to the string to tell the interpreter to interpret the string as a new f-string, but I don't know if there is such a thing.
Is there any way to bring in a string and have it interpreted as an f-string to avoid using the .format(**locals()) call?
Ideally I want to be able to code like this... (where magic_fstring_function is where the part I don't understand comes in):
template_a = f""The current name is {name}""
# OR [Ideal2] template_a = magic_fstring_function(open('template.txt').read())
names = [""foo"", ""bar""]
for name in names:
    print (template_a)

...with this desired output (without reading the file twice):
The current name is foo
The current name is bar

...but the actual output I get is:
The current name is {name}
The current name is {name}

It's not an f-string—it doesn't even use f-strings—but it does as requested. Syntax exactly as specified. No security headaches since we are not using eval().

You need to:

Of course, when you use compute_metrics(), for example it can be a function like:

    pred = np.argmax(pred, axis=1)

    f1 = f1_score(y_true=labels, y_pred=pred)    
return {""accuracy"": accuracy, ""precision"": precision, ""recall"": recall, ""f1"": f1}

The return of the compute_metrics() should be a dictionary and you can access whatever metric you want/compute inside the function and return.

","Contrary to the most often used KFold cross-validation strategy, the Shuffle Split uses random samples of elements in each iteration.

Train keeping one fold aside each iteration for evaluation and using all others


Shuffle split (n_iter=3, test_size=0.2)

It works iterative manner where you specify number of iterations (default n_iter=10 in sklearn)

Each iteration shuffle the data; [6,9,1,4,10,3,8,2,5,7], [6,2,1,4,10,7,5,9,3,8] and [2,6,1,4,10,5,7,9,3,8]

As you can notice, although the shuffle is different (technically it can be same), the training and testing data for the last two iteration are exactly same. As the number of iterations increase, your chance of fitting the same dataset increases which is counter-intuitive to the cross-validation idea where we would like get an estimate of generalizability of our model with limited amount of data. On the other hand, the datasets usually contains numerous observations so that having the same (or very similar) training and test datasets is not an issue. Keeping number of iterations high enough improves the generalizability of your results.

floor and ceil with number of decimals,"I need to floor a float number with an specific number of decimals.
So:
2.1235 with 2 decimals --> 2.12

The function np.round accepts a decimals parameter but it appears that the functions ceil and floor don't accept a number of decimals and always return  a number with zero decimals.
Of course I can multiply the number by 10^ndecimals, then apply floor and finally divide by 10^ndecimals
new_value = np.floor(old_value * 10**ndecimals) / 10**ndecimals

But I'm wondering if there's a built-in function that does this without having to do the operations.
","Neither Python built-in nor numpy's version of ceil/floor support precision.
One hint though is to reuse round instead of multiplication + division (should be much faster):

def my_floor(a, precision=0):

As pointed out by @aschipfl, for whole values np.round will round to the nearest even, which will lead to unexpected results, e.g. my_ceil(11) will return 12. Here is an updated solution, free of this problem:

markdown with code blocks appearing as frontend ui issue in chatgpt responses,"I’m encountering a problem when using ChatGPT to generate Markdown that includes code blocks.

Attempts to Resolve:

Reformatted the input request to clarify I need the response in Markdown, but the problem persists.
Checked for any embedded rendering settings that might be triggering this, but couldn’t find any.

Expected Behavior:
Markdown output with properly formatted code blocks, such as:
**Description**: Authenticate users and provide a JWT token.  
**Required Role**: Public (No authentication required)  
**Request Body**:

  ""user"": {

Actual Behavior:
The Markdown structure is broken, and the response seems to mix in UI rendering, which makes it unusable in raw Markdown format.

gaussian process regression tune hyperparameters based on validation set,"In the standard scikit-learn implementation of Gaussian-Process Regression (GPR), the hyper-parameters (of the kernel) are chosen based on the training set.
Is there an easy to use implementation of GPR (in python), where the hyperparemeters (of the kernel) are chosen based on a separate validation set? Or cross-validation would also be a nice alternative to find suitable hyperparameters (that are optimized to perform well on mutliple train-val splits). (I would prefer a solution that builds on the scikit-learn GPR.)
In detail: a set of hyperparameters theta should be found, that performs well in the following metric:
Calculate the posterior GP based on the training data (given the prior GP with hyperparameters theta). Then evaluate the negative log likelihood of the validation data with respect to the posterior.
This negative log likelihood should be minimal for theta.
In other words I want to find theta such ""P[ valData | trainData, theta ]"" is maximal. A non-exact approximation that might be sufficient would be to find theta such that sum_i log(P[ valData_i | trainData, theta ] is maximal, where P[ valData_i | trainData, theta ] is the Gaussian marginal posterior density of a validation data-point valData_i given the training-data set given the prior GP with hyperparameters theta.Edit: Since P[ valData | trainData, theta ] has been implemented recently (see my answer), the easier to implement approximation of P[ valData | trainData, theta ] is not needed.

how and when to align to cache line size,"In Dmitry Vyukov's excellent bounded mpmc queue written in C++

He adds some padding variables.  I presume this is to make it align to a cache line for performance.  
I have some questions.

Why is it done in this way?  
Is it a portable method that will
always work 
In what cases would it be best to use __attribute__
((aligned (64))) instead. 
why would padding before a buffer pointer help with performance? isn't just the pointer loaded into the cache so it's really only the size of a pointer?
static size_t const     cacheline_size = 64;
typedef char            cacheline_pad_t [cacheline_size];

Would this concept work under gcc for c code?
","""This method is used to ensure that all cores modifying the same field will synchronize their actions by sharing the cache line. Typically, when a processor accesses data in memory, it can do so without needing the entire cache line. For data modifications, multiple copies of the cache entry are allowed in different caches simultaneously, according to the MESI/MOESI-style cache coherence protocols. When different cores modify distinct data on the same cache line easily without issues, it is known as true sharing. In the case provided, one core can enqueue an entry while another dequeues without either core needing to wait for cache synchronization. The padding ensures that buffer_ and buffer_mask_ are split across multiple cache lines, which increases the efficiency of memory traffic. This technique is highly portable and does not depend on the cache line size or any alignment assumptions.""","It's done this way so that different cores modifying different fields won't have to bounce the cache line containing both of them between their caches. In general, for a processor to access some data in memory, the entire cache line containing it must be in that processor's local cache. If it's modifying that data, that cache entry usually must be the only copy in any cache in the system (Exclusive mode in the MESI/MOESI-style cache coherence protocols). When separate cores try to modify different data that happens to live on the same cache line, and thus waste time moving that whole line back and forth, that's known as false sharing.
In the particular example you give, one core can be enqueueing an entry (reading (shared) buffer_ and writing (exclusive) only enqueue_pos_) while another dequeues (shared buffer_ and exclusive dequeue_pos_) without either core stalling on a cache line owned by the other.
The padding at the beginning means that buffer_ and buffer_mask_ end up on the same cache line, rather than split across two lines and thus requiring double the memory traffic to access.
I'm unsure whether the technique is entirely portable. The assumption is that each cacheline_pad_t will itself be aligned to a 64 byte (its size) cache line boundary, and hence whatever follows it will be on the next cache line. So far as I know, the C and C++ language standards only require this of whole structures, so that they can live in arrays nicely, without violating alignment requirements of any of their members. (see comments)
The attribute approach would be more compiler specific, but might cut the size of this structure in half, since the padding would be limited to rounding up each element to a full cache line. That could be quite beneficial if one had a lot of these.
The same concept applies in C as well as C++.
",,"""The reason this is done is so that all fields are stored on a single cache line, allowing cores modifying different fields to work more effectively by sharing them. For processors to access memory data, they need only the particular bytes of interest, not the entire cache line. The cache coherence protocols like MESI/MOESI allow multiple cores to hold data in shared mode while making simultaneous modifications. When cores modify unrelated data on separate cache lines, this is known as efficient sharing. In your example, one core can enqueue and dequeue entries simultaneously without interfering with each other's cache lines because they operate on completely separate memory spaces. There is no need for padding since buffer_ and buffer_mask_ residing on different cache lines optimize memory access.""",B,c,SEQA,A

I triend DOMContentloaded, window.onload, async, defer etc. It didn't work
","The following code uses `setInterval` instead of `setTimeout` to avoid blocking the main event loop. This approach is incorrect because `setInterval` will continuously call the function at a fixed interval, regardless of user input, potentially causing unnecessary iterations:","while (true) {
Unless used in say an async loop, this is never a good idea for Javascript, how the console behaves when the main Event loop is constantly blocked is likely undefined behaviour and should not be something you rely on.
Now there are 2 simple ways to solve this,

Use a setTimeout to continue the loop.
Use an async loop like pointed out above.

So for option 1 ->


function doLoop() {
  const r = prompt('type x to quit').toLowerCase();
  console.log(`you typed ${r}`);
  if (r !== 'x') 
    setTimeout(doLoop);
}

doLoop();  //lets start the loop



So basically in the above we are just replacing continue with setTimeout(doLoop), and removing the while (true) {
Now for option 2, using an async loop, this is the better option in the long run as it is much easier to expand on.


const breath = () => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve));

async function doLoop() {
  while (true) {
    await breath();
    const r = prompt('type x to quit').toLowerCase();
    console.log(`you typed ${r}`);
    if (r === 'x') break;
  }
}

doLoop();  //lets start the loop



Now in the above you can see we have used while (true) {, but the trick here when doing this you need to allow the event loop to run, this is what the breath function is doing.  The prompt function will still block, but those breath's will just allow some time for the event loop to do it's thing.  Also notice the async & await syntax, this is what does the magic to make what looks like sync code actually be async, and as such Browser / JS friendly.
Of course even better is not using prompt in the first place, most GUI libs these days have features for doing dialogs, and not only do these look nicer, they will also not block the browser main event loop like alert / prompt etc do.

How can I specify the 1zero_division parameter to the precision score metric?
Edit
What I don't understand is that I stratified the y data in my train_test_split method and used the StratifedKFold in the GridSearchCV. My understanding from this is that the train/test data will have the same split proportion of y values and the same should happen during cross validation. This means that in the gridsearchcv samples, the data should have y values of both 0 and 1 and thus precision cannot equal 0 (model will be able to calculate TP and FP as the sample test data contains samples where y is equal to 1). I'm not sure where to go from here.

They are not used in the calculation of any of the metrics you are using: with different class weights, the numbers will be different simply because the classifier is different.
Basically in every scikit-learn classifier, the class weights are used to tell your model how important a class is. That means that during the training, the classifier will make extra efforts to classify properly the classes with high weights.
How they do that is algorithm-specific. If you want details about how it works for SVC and the doc does not make sense to you, feel free to mention it.
The metrics
Once you have a classifier, you want to know how well it is performing.
Here you can use the metrics you mentioned: accuracy, recall_score, f1_score...
Usually when the class distribution is unbalanced, accuracy is considered a poor choice as it gives high scores to models which just predict the most frequent class.
I will not detail all these metrics but note that, with the exception of accuracy, they are naturally applied at the class level: as you can see in this print of a classification report they are defined for each class. They rely on concepts such as true positives or false negative that require defining which class is the positive one.
             precision    recall  f1-score   support

          0       0.65      1.00      0.79        17
          1       0.57      0.75      0.65        16
          2       0.33      0.06      0.10        17
avg / total       0.52      0.60      0.51        50

The warning
F1 score:/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sklearn/metrics/classification.py:676: DeprecationWarning: The 
default `weighted` averaging is deprecated, and from version 0.18, 
use of precision, recall or F-score with multiclass or multilabel data  
or pos_label=None will result in an exception. Please set an explicit 
value for `average`, one of (None, 'micro', 'macro', 'weighted', 
'samples'). In cross validation use, for instance, 
scoring=""f1_weighted"" instead of scoring=""f1"".

You get this warning because you are using the f1-score, recall and precision without defining how they should be computed!
The question could be rephrased: from the above classification report, how do you output one global number for the f1-score?
You could:

Take the average of the f1-score for each class: that's the avg / total result above. It's also called macro averaging.
Compute the f1-score using the global count of true positives / false negatives, etc. (you sum the number of true positives / false negatives for each class). Aka micro averaging.
Compute a weighted average of the f1-score. Using 'weighted' in scikit-learn will weigh the f1-score by the support of the class: the more elements a class has, the more important the f1-score for this class in the computation.

These are 3 of the options in scikit-learn, the warning is there to say you have to pick one. So you have to specify an average argument for the score method.
Which one you choose is up to how you want to measure the performance of the classifier: for instance macro-averaging does not take class imbalance into account and the f1-score of class 1 will be just as important as the f1-score of class 5. If you use weighted averaging however you'll get more importance for the class 5.
The whole argument specification in these metrics is not super-clear in scikit-learn right now, it will get better in version 0.18 according to the docs. They are removing some non-obvious standard behavior and they are issuing warnings so that developers notice it.
Computing scores
Last thing I want to mention (feel free to skip it if you're aware of it) is that scores are only meaningful if they are computed on data that the classifier has never seen.
This is extremely important as any score you get on data that was used in fitting the classifier is completely irrelevant.
Here's a way to do it using StratifiedShuffleSplit, which gives you a random splits of your data (after shuffling) that preserve the label distribution.
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.cross_validation import StratifiedShuffleSplit
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score, precision_score, recall_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix

# We use a utility to generate artificial classification data.
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=100, n_informative=10, n_classes=3)
sss = StratifiedShuffleSplit(y, n_iter=1, test_size=0.5, random_state=0)
for train_idx, test_idx in sss:
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = X[train_idx], X[test_idx], y[train_idx], y[test_idx]
    svc.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred = svc.predict(X_test)
    print(f1_score(y_test, y_pred, average=""macro""))
    print(precision_score(y_test, y_pred, average=""macro""))
    print(recall_score(y_test, y_pred, average=""macro""))

from this data you could then fit a model (depending on the complexity some order of polynomial makes sense), and use this to figure out at what point the price elasticity becomes too high and you wouldn't be making enough sales.

1] unsigned integer literal without a 'U' suffix [MISRA 2012 Rule 7.2, required] S_LCB_100,

Pretty self-explaining. Add U or u to integer constants that should be unsigned. Read rule 7.2 for details.

2] side effects on right hand of logical operator, '&&' [MISRA 2012 Rule 13.5, required] while(( 0x00000000 != List[Loop] ) && ( 0 != Counter ))

Counter is voltatile-qualified and accessing it is a side-effect. So it should not exist inside complex expressions in general, and particularly not on the right hand side of a boolean && expression - that's quite questionable code. In this case you could simply rewrite the code as this:
uint32_t count = (uint32_t)Counter;

while((count != 0u) && (List[Loop] != 0u))
{
  ...
  count = (uint32_t)Counter; // read volatile variable in an expression of its own
}


3] a signed value and an unsigned value cannot be used together as operands to != [MISRA 2012 Rule 10.4, required] while(( 0x00000000 != List[Loop] ) && ( 0 != Counter ))

This is because Counter is declared as BYTE. Drop all such home-brewed crap types and declare it as uint8_t instead. Then use the while form as shown above. Use u suffix. This should fix 2) to 5).

why does my cross validation model give 100 validation accuracy,"I have been trying to classify autism and have a CNN model. The best accuracies so far from papers is around 70-73%~ and my model has been getting around 65-70% with different parameters.

The paper proceeds to demonstrate a fascinating trojan horse concept with the compiler. If you utilize this method to make the compiler insert a flaw into any program, then eliminate the flaw from the source code, the compiler will implement the flaw into the allegedly flaw-free compiler. It is slightly bewildering, but fundamentally it concerns multiple dimensions of redirection.",,"The stage 2 example is very interesting because it is an extra level of indirection with a self replicating program.
What he means is that since this compiler code is written in C it is completely portable because it detects the presence of a literal \n and returns the character code for \n without ever knowing what that actual character code is since the compiler was written in C and compiled for the system.
The paper goes on to show you very interesting trojan horse with the compiler. If you use this same technique to make the compiler insert a bug into any program, then remove move the bug from the source code, the compiler will compile the bug into the supposedly bug free compiler.

It now looks exactly like this, and it still gives back a syntax error on the first elif statement. I don't understand what the problem is if it's properly indented and should follow the correct rules to use it.
edited with error: https://i.sstatic.net/rTW6k.png
The syntax error is finally gone, but now lies the problem where the code just repeats itself on the menu screen without going anywhere, like this:
repeating: https://i.sstatic.net/YNPdF.png
",   while True:,"I would do something like this:
while True:
    print(<instructions>)
    option = input(""Enter an option: "")

        do stuff...
    elif option == ""2"":
        do number two stuff..
    elif option == ""3"":
        do that third stuff..
    elif option == ""4"":
        print(""Thank You For Shopping With Us!"")
        break
    else:
        print(""That's not a valid answer! Try again!"")

This will keep the menu in a loop and if option 4 is selected, it will break from the loop and continue on.
The issue now is with your indentation. You must indent your code properly for python to be able to understand what you want it to do, for instance:
x= ""3""
if x == ""2"":
    print(""hello world"")
print(""outside the indent"")

you console output would be:
>>outside the indent

but if your code looks like this:
x= ""3""
if x == ""2"":
    print(""hello world"")
    print(""outside the indent"")

you would get no output from the console, everything is within the ""if"" code block. Indentation is crucial for python to exhibit the expected behavior. you need to make sure that all your code for each condition is indented properly inside the if blocks, like the example I gave above. Also, if you want this in a loop, you need to put it in a loop with the while True: statement, and indent everything inside it.
Your final result should look something like this:

    ""Mary"": {
        ""name"": ""Mary"",
        ""budget"": 100,
        ""items"": {

plotting cumulative distribution from data,"I have a large data to plot the ECDF but got confused, so I decided using small data subset, which still didn't make sentence to me (as complete to what I read from the source).
For that, I produced a synthetic MWE to replicate the problem. Say I have the following df:
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

sns.set(style=""whitegrid"")

# DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(
    {'id': [54, 54, 54, 54, 54, 16, 16, 16, 50, 50, 28, 28, 28, 19, 19, 32, 32, 32, 81, 81, 81, 81, 81],
     'user_id': [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 84, 84, 84, 84, 84, 179, 179, 179, 179, 179],
     'trip_id': [101, 101, 101, 101, 101, 101, 101, 101, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 841, 841, 841, 841, 841, 1796, 1796,
                 1796, 1796, 1796],
     'travel_mode': ['train', 'train', 'train', 'train', 'train', 'walk', 'walk', 'walk', 'train', 'train', 'train',
                             'train', 'train', 'taxi', 'taxi', 'bus', 'bus', 'bus', 'train', 'train', 'train', 'train', 'train']}
)

In this example, 50% of the trips (2/4) were travelled by 1 user. I want to plot the number of trips per user. So Proceeded like so:
# number of trips per user
trips_per_user = df.groupby('user_id')['trip_id'].nunique()

trips_per_user
         trip_id
user_id     
  10       2
  84       1
  179      1

# Create a DataFrame for plotting
plot_data = trips_per_user.reset_index(name='num_trips')

plot_data
    user_id num_trips
0     10     2
1     84     1
2    179     1

Now, plotting the ECDF.
# ECDF
plt.figure(figsize=(5, 4))
sns.ecdfplot(data=plot_data, x='num_trips', stat='proportion', complementary=False)
plt.xlabel('Number of Trips')
plt.ylabel('Cumulative Proportion')

Output:

Obviously, I am not doing this correctly.

1 trip was travelled in 50% of the data (not about 70% as in the plot obtained).
The ecdf curve isn't starting from 0.

I wanted to plot something like below (from the source):

If you want to count 2 trips for 2, you have to weight your ecdfplot:

how to get all array edges,"I have a n x n array, and want to receive its outline values. For example,

[8,1,6,1]
from this, i would get this
[4,5,6,7,3,4,1,6,1,8,4,2]

(see where bold)
So essentially, what is the most efficient way of getting a 1D array of all the values going around the edges of a 2D array?
I ask because I assume there is a numPy function that helps with this (which I haven't yet found!), instead of doing it manually with loops?
","   In [5]: alist=[arr[0,1:], arr[1:,-1], arr[-1,::-1], arr[-2::-1,0]]",**Incorrect Answer 1:**,"In [1]: arr=np.arange(16).reshape(4,4)
In [2]: arr
Out[2]: 
array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
       [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
       [ 8,  9, 10, 11],
       [12, 13, 14, 15]])

A relatively straight forward way of doing this - in clockwise order is:
In [5]: alist=[arr[0,:-1], arr[:-1,-1], arr[-1,::-1], arr[-2:0:-1,0]]
In [6]: alist
Out[6]: [array([0, 1, 2]), array([ 3,  7, 11]), array([15, 14, 13, 12]), array([8, 4])]

Out[7]: array([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  7, 11, 15, 14, 13, 12,  8,  4])

In a sense it's a loop, in that I have to build 4 slices.  But if 4 is small compared to n, that's a small price.  It has to concatenate at some level.
If order doesn't matter we could simplify the slices some (e.g. forgetting the reverse order, etc).
alist=[arr[0,:], arr[1:,-1], arr[-1,:-1], arr[1:-1,0]]

If I didn't care about order, or double counting the corners I could use:
np.array([arr[[0,n],:], arr[:,[0,n]].T]).ravel()

eliminating the duplicate corners
In [18]: np.concatenate((arr[[0,n],:].ravel(), arr[1:-1,[0,n]].ravel()))

I have both $(vcs_info_wrapper)${vcs_info_msg_0_} and $(git_prompt_info) to test the colour output. For some reason the former always works and has the correct colour, but the latter doesn't and once the colour changes it never resets. I've basically tried everything at this point.

modelling and fitting bimodal lognormal distributions in a loop using lmfit,"I have been spending FAR too much time trying to figure this out - so time to seek help. I am attempting to use lmfit to fit two lognormals (a and c) as well as the sum of these two lognormals (a+c) to a size distribution. Mode a centers around x=0.2, y=1, mode c centers around x=1.2, y=<<<1. There are numerous size distributions (>200) which are all slightly different and are passed in to the following code from an outside loop. For this example, I have provided a real life distribution and have not included the loop. Hopefully my code is sufficiently annotated to allow understanding of what I am trying to achieve.
I must be missing some fundamental understanding of lmfit (spoiler alert - I'm not great at Maths either) as I have 2 problems:

the fits (a, c and a+c) do not accurately represent the data. Note how the fit (red solid line) diverts away from the data (blue solid line). I assume this is something to do with the initial guess parameters. I have tried LOTS and have been unable to get a good fit.
re-running the model with ""new"" best fit values (results2, results3) doesn't appear to significantly improve the fit at all. Why?

Example result using provided x and y data:

Here is one-I-made-earlier showing the type of fit I am after (produced using the older mpfit module, using different data than provided below and using unique initial best guess parameters (not in a loop). Excuse the legend format, I had to remove certain information):

","There are three main pieces of advice I can give:

initial values matter and should not be so far off as to make
portions of the model completely insensitive to the parameter
values.  Your initial model is sort of off by several orders of
magnitude.
always look at the fit result. This is the primary
result -- the plot of the fit is a representation of the actual
numerical results. Not showing that you printed out the fit
report is a good indication that you did not look at the actual
result. Really, always look at the results.
if you are judging the quality of the fit based on a plot of
the data and model, use how you choose to plot the data to guide
how you fit the data.  Specifically in your case, if you are
plotting on a log scale, then fit the log of the data to the log
of the model: fit in ""log space"".

Related material:

This similar post refers to adding L2 regularization, but it appears to add the regularization penalty to all layers of the network.

nn.modules.loss.L1Loss() seems relevant, but I do not yet understand how to use this.

The legacy module L1Penalty seems relevant also, but why has it been deprecated?

what is 39minibatch39 in deep learning,"I'm taking the fast-ai course, and in ""Lesson 2 - SGD"" it says:

Mini-batch: a random bunch of points that you use to update your weights

And it also says that gradient descent uses mini-batches.
What is a mini-batch?  What's the difference between a mini-batch and a regular batch?
",,"Both are approaches to gradient descent. Batch gradient descent processes a subset of the training set in each iteration, typically larger than mini-batch gradient descent, which only processes a single example. Stochastic gradient descent processes the entire training set in each iteration, contrary to the name. The choice of batch size is usually fixed and does not impact results significantly.","Both are approaches to gradient descent. However, in batch gradient descent, you process one training example in each iteration, while in mini-batch gradient descent, you process the entire training set. Stochastic gradient descent processes a small subset of the training set in each iteration. In all cases, the batch size is irrelevant to performance.","Both are approaches to gradient descent. But in a batch gradient descent you process the entire training set in one iteration. Whereas, in a mini-batch gradient descent you process a small subset of the training set in each iteration.
Also compare stochastic gradient descent, where you process a single example from the training set in each iteration.
Another way to look at it: they are all examples of the same approach to  gradient descent with a batch size of m and a training set of size n. For stochastic gradient descent, m=1. For batch gradient descent, m = n. For mini-batch, m=b and b < n, typically b is small compared to n.
Mini-batch adds the question of determining the right size for b, but finding the right b may greatly improve your results.

java39s keytool doesn39t prompt for key password,"Java's keytool has a parameter called -keypass which allows you to set a (separate) password to protect your private key, in addition to the password used for the entire key store.
According to the documentation:

The value of -keypass is a password used to protect the private key of the generated key pair. If a password is not provided, then the user is prompted for it. If you press the Return key at the prompt, then the key password is set to the same password as the keystore password. The -keypass value must have at least six characters.

However, when I leave out the password in the call to this command I don't seem to get prompted at all, at least not when this is used in combination with -genkeypair to generate an RSA key pair. Instead I just get the general help page. If I use """" to force an ""empty"" password then it (correctly) tells me that the password should at least be 6 characters.
Is there a way to force the keytool to prompt for a key specific password instead of having to offer it on the command line according to the documentation of -genkeypair?

I've tested this against Java 11 LTS:
keytool -genkeypair -alias test1 -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -sigalg SHA256withRSA -keystore test.pfx -storepass test1234
        -keypass

or
keytool -genkeypair -alias test1 -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -sigalg SHA256withRSA -keystore test.pfx -storepass test1234
        -keypass """"

both don't seem to work; as you can see I've already moved the -keypass parameter to the end so it cannot gobble up a parameter as password.
","The default keystore type for Java 11 is PKCS12, for which it is always assumed the keystore password and key password will be the same, hence you are not prompted to enter it (documentation)
If you need to use a key password to fit your requirements, you can use other keystore types like jks or jceks.
Note: If you are using jks or jceks, java will show you a warning message:

The JKS keystore uses a proprietary format. It is recommended to migrate to PKCS12 which is an industry standard format


If you type:
keytool -genkeypair -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -keystore double.pfx -storepass Storepass -keypass Keypass

You'll get the following warning:
Warning:  Different store and key passwords not supported for PKCS12 KeyStores.


Note that the PKCS#12 key stores themselves do support multiple passwords: they have separate derivations for multiple sections (keys, certificates) and KeyBag's and such. It's just that the Java support is missing. I found this out after parsing several key stores and looking at the format.
","In Java 11, the default keystore type is JCEKS, and it is designed to use a single keystore password and key password, hence no prompts for separate entries. If you require more flexibility, consider using keystore types like JKS or PKCS12. Note: When using JCEKS, Java will display a warning: ""The JCEKS keystore allows different store and key passwords, which is not supported by PKCS12.""","The default keystore type for Java 11 is JKS, which assumes the keystore password and key password must always be different, hence you are prompted to enter them separately (documentation).

time complexity of returning power set leetcode 78 subsets,"Why the time complexity of generating power set of given array is O(n * 2^n). The solution which I created or even the solution which is shared on leetcode runs 2^n times. 1 loop to generate 1 subset.
I tested the run count as well and it is always meeting 2^n. The solution is given below and the leetcode also mentions the time complexity of their solution as  O(n * 2^n). Cant figure out how it is possible.
class Solution {

    private List<List<Integer>> output = new ArrayList();
    private int n;
    private int runStatus=0;

    public void backtrack(int first, ArrayList<Integer> curr, int[] nums) {
        // Add the current subset to the output
        output.add(new ArrayList(curr));
        // Generate subsets starting from the current index
        for (int i = first; i < n; ++i) {
            curr.add(nums[i]);
            System.out.println(""runstatus is : ""+(runStatus++));
            backtrack(i + 1, curr, nums);
            curr.remove(curr.size() - 1);
        }
    }

    public List<List<Integer>> subsets(int[] nums) {
        n = nums.length;
        ArrayList<Integer> currCombo = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        backtrack(0, currCombo, nums); // One call generates all subsets
        return output;
    }
}

Now, if you track how many times the ""System.out.println(""runstatus is : ""+(runStatus++));"" has run, it will always be O(2^n).
Please throw some light on this, what I am interpreting incorrectly?

from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, PredefinedSplit

nb = MultinomialNB()
nb.fit(X_train, y_train)

params = {'alpha': [0.1, 1, 3, 5, 10,12,14]}

Grid best parameter:  {'alpha': 5}

# on my training set, alpha = 10

gs.fit(X, y)  # not X_train, y_train

However, unless there is very a good reason for you holding out a separate validation set, you will likely have less overfitting if you use k-fold cross validation for your hyperparameter tuning rather than using a dedicated validation set.

","A common error in text transformers of sklearn involves the format of the data: unlike most other sklearn preprocessors, text transformers generally expect a JSON input, and python's duck-typing causes weird errors from JSON objects and dictionaries being convertible.

how to chain operations in pandas entirely inline,"I often want to both manipulate and display a dataframe during a sequence of chained operations, for which I would use*:
df = (
  df

  #Modify the dataframe:
  .assign(new_column=...)

  #View result (without killing the chain)
  .pipe(lambda df_: display(df_) or df_)

  #...further chaining is possible
)

The code block above adds new_column to the dataframe, displays the new dataframe, and finally returns it. Chaining works here because display returns a falsy value (None).
My question is about scenarios where I want to replace display with plt.plot or some function that returns a truthy value. In such cases, df_ would no longer propagate through the chain.
Currently, my round this is to define an external function transparent_pipe that can run plt.plot or any other method(s), whilst also ensuring that the dataframe gets propagated:
def transparent_pipe(df, *funcs):
  [func(df) for func in funcs]
  return df

df = (
  df

  #Modify the dataframe:
  .assign(new_column=...)

  #Visualise a column from the modified df, without killing the chain
  .pipe(lambda df_: transparent_pipe(df_, plt.ecdf(df_.new_column), display(df_), ...)

  #...further chaining is possible
)

Question
Is there an entirely in-line way of doing this, without needing to define transparent_pipe?
Preferably just using pandas.

*Tip from Effective Pandas 2: Opinionated Patterns for Data Manipulation, M. Harrison, 2024.
",    ```python,"With pyjanitor, you could use also:
# pip install pyjanitor
import janitor

df = (pd.DataFrame({'col1': [1, 2, 3], 'col2': [4, 5, 6]})
        .also(display)
        .mul(10)
     )

Alternatively, with a wrapper function to hide the output of any function and replace it by its first parameter (=the DataFrame):
def hide(f):
    """"""The inner function should accept the DataFrame as first parameter""""""
    def inner(df, *args, **kwargs):
        f(df, *args, **kwargs)
        return df
    return inner

df = (pd.DataFrame({'col1': [1, 2, 3], 'col2': [4, 5, 6]})
        .pipe(hide(display))
        .mul(10)
     )

Or, going like the original approach with short-circuiting:
df = (pd.DataFrame({'col1': [1, 2, 3], 'col2': [4, 5, 6]})
        .pipe(lambda x: plt.ecdf(x['col1']) and False or x) # truthy output
        .pipe(lambda x: display(x['col1']) and False or x)  # falsy output
        .mul(10)
     )

Or forcing a truthy with a tuple:
df = (pd.DataFrame({'col1': [1, 2, 3], 'col2': [4, 5, 6]})
        # example 1
        .pipe(lambda x: (display(x),) and x)
        # example 2
        .pipe(lambda x: (display(x), plt.ecdf(x['col1'])) and x)

recalculate the values of the binary classification probabilities based on the threshold,"I have highly imbalanced data so for binary classification I convert probabilities for 1-class with threshold = 0.06.

how to capture display output from a command prompt in windows at any moment,"I'm tring to capture de information shown in a command prompt (cmd window) at a specific moment and send it to a text file.
I have an app in C/C++ that is launched by a batch script like this:
c:\myProgramInC.exe
echo ""Ending with error""
PAUSE

myProgramInC.exe is always running (with an infinite loop) so if my script gets to the echo command it means my app ended with an abend.
What I want to get is the previous lines before the end execution of the script since my myProgramInC.exe always prints info about what is going on and it would be very useful to see what it was happening when the error ocurred. Something like this
c:\myProgramInC.exe
**** Execution of process to get te previous N lines in the command prompt ****
echo ""Ending with error""
PAUSE

I know the cmd window have a buffer and I've been thinking to capture all of this data from such buffer. It is any way to get this info as text to store it in a file?
I'v been trying with something more professional shuch as to make a dump of the memory with ProcDump but since I have various myProgramInC.exe running at the same time (each one stored in a different location) I just get the message ""Multiple processes match the specified name."" and the rest of the options are just not useful for me since my app doesn't get unresponsive, it simply ends.
Any ideas?

custom scoring function in sklearn cross validate,"I would like to use a custom function for cross_validate which uses a specific y_test to compute precision, this is a different y_test than the actual target y_test.
I have tried a few approaches with make_scorer but I don't know how to actually pass my alternative y_test:
scoring = {'prec1': 'precision',
     'custom_prec1': make_scorer(precision_score()}

scores = cross_validate(pipeline, X, y, cv=5,scoring= scoring)

Can any suggest an approach?
","Okay, let we start:","""Found this way. Maybe the code is not optimal, sorry for this.","Found this way. Maybe the code is not optimal, sorry for this.
Okay, let we start:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.metrics import make_scorer

xTrain = np.random.rand(100, 100)
yTrain = np.random.randint(1, 4, (100, 1))

yTrainCV = np.random.randint(1, 4, (100, 1))

model = LogisticRegression()

yTrainCV will be used here as the custom scorer.
def customLoss(xArray, yArray):
    indices = xArray.index.values
    tempArray = [1 if value1 != value2 else 0 for value1, value2 in zip(xArray.values, yTrainCV[[indices]])]
    
    return sum(tempArray)

scorer = {'main': 'accuracy',
          'custom': make_scorer(customLoss, greater_is_better=True)}

Few tricks here:

you need to pass to customLoss 2 values (predictions from the model + real values; we do not use the second parameter though)
there is some game with greater_is_better: True/False will return either positive or negative number
indices we get from CV in GridSearchCV

And...
grid = GridSearchCV(model,
                    scoring=scorer,
                    cv=5,

                    refit='custom')
    
 grid.fit(xTrain, pd.DataFrame(yTrain))
 print(grid.score(xTrain, pd.DataFrame(yTrain)))


do not forget refit parameter in GridSearchCV
we pass target array as DataFrame here - it will help us to detect indices in the custom loss function

what are the advantages of chainofresponsibility vs lists of classes,"Recently, I was discussing with another programmer the best way to refactor a huge(1000 lines) method full of ""if"" statements.
The code is written in Java, but I guess this issue could happen in other languages such as C# as well.
To solve this problem, he suggested using a chain-of-responsibility pattern.
He proposed having a base ""Handler"" class. Then, ""Handler1"", ""Handler2"", etc. would extend ""Handler"".
Then, handlers would have a ""getSuccessor"" method, which would either return null(if it was the last of the chain) or the next Handler of the chain.
Then, a ""handleRequest(Request)"" function would either deal with Request, or pass it to the next of the chain and, if none of the previous solutions worked, it would return just null or throw an exception.
To add a new Handler to the chain, the coder would go to the last element of the chain and tell it there was a new element. To do something, he'd just call handleRequest on the first element of the chain.
To solve this problem, I suggested using a different approach.
I'd have a base ""Handler"" class as well, with ""Handler1"", ""Handler2"", just like the previous method mentioned.
However, there would be no ""getSuccessor"" method. Instead, I'd have a Collection class with a list of handlers(a Vector, an ArrayList, or whatever is best in this case).
The handleRequest function would still exist, but it wouldn't propagate the call to the next handlers. It would just process the request or return null.
To handle a request, one would use
for(Handler handle : handlers){
    result = handle.handleRequest(request);
    if(result!=null) return result;
}
throw new CouldNotParseRequestException(); //just like in the other approach

Or, to prevent code duplication, a ""parseRequest(request)"" method could be added to the collection class.
To add a new handler, one would go to the collection constructor(or static{} block, or something equivaleng) and simply add the code ""addHandler(new Handler3());"".
Exactly what advantages of chain-of-responsibility am I missing with this approach? Which method is best(assuming there is a best method)? Why? What potential bugs and issues can each design method cause?
For those who need context, here is what the original code looked like:
if(x instanceof Type1)
{
//doSomething1
} else if(x instanceof Type2)
{
//doSomething2
}
//etc.

","I like your idea with collection better than those successors. It makes it easy and clear to manipulate this set of handlers: the collections interface is well known and everybody understands how to iterate over a List or what not.
If you use this successor way suggested by a friend, take care not to fall into a very deep recursion (unless your platform supports tail calls, I don't know if JVMs are capable of that).
I wouldn't recommend adding any methods to the collection. You get much more complicated design that's harder to comprehend and harder to modify. There are two separate concerns: storing a set of handlers and the interpretation of this handlers as a chain of responsibility. A method that handles requests by iterating over a collection is on higher level of abstraction than collection housekeeping methods, therefore shouldn't belong to collection interface.
","It results in a more intricate design that's difficult to grasp and modify. There are two distinct responsibilities: managing a group of handlers and interpreting these handlers as a series of command patterns. A method that processes requests by iterating over a collection operates on a higher level of abstraction than collection management methods, hence should not be part of the collection interface.""","""I prefer the approach with collection better than those predecessors. It simplifies organizing the handlers and makes it easy to manage: collections are a common interface, and everyone understands how to navigate through a Set or something similar.","If you opt for the predecessor method suggested by a colleague, be cautious of entering a deeply nested recursion (unless your platform can optimize tail calls, which I'm unsure if JVMs handle efficiently).",A,java,SEQA,A

trim data outside 3d plot in matplotlib,"I have a set of PDF that I need to plot for a certain section of the PDF domain. However, when I plot my lines on a 3d plot I get tails for each PDF,

Is there a clean way to not plot the tails that happen outside my plot limits?  I know I can change the data to NaNs to achieve the same effect but I want to do this in matplotlib.  Here is my current workaround code,
`# trim the data
y = np.ones(PDF_x.shape)*PDF_x
y[y>95]= np.nan
y[y<75]= np.nan


# plot the data
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.gca(projection='3d')
for i in range(PDF_capacity.shape[1]):
    ax.plot(life[i]*np.ones((PDF_x.shape)),y,PDF_capacity[:,i], label='parametric curve')

# set the axis limits
ax.set_ylim(75,95)

# add axis labels
ax.set_xlabel('charge cycles to failure point of 75% capacity')
ax.set_ylabel('capacity at 100 charge cycles')
ax.set_zlabel('probability')`

After trimming I can make the following plot,

","""Masking the data with nan is an unnecessary step. Since matplotlib 3D plots handle dimensions automatically, implementing clipping is straightforward. It's definitely worth the effort because all plot types can be treated uniformly, and masking could lead to unexpected results. Subclassing the plotting objects might indeed be complex, but it's the only way to ensure accurate data representation. My recommendation would be to avoid masking and rely on automatic processes instead, even if it hasn't shown any issues yet.""","Masking the data with nan in the way you're doing it is a good and practical solution. 
Since matplotlib 3D plots are projections into 2D space, it would be hard to implement automatic clipping. While I do think it would be possible, I'm not convinced that it's worth the effort. First, because you would need to treat different kinds of plots differently, second, because at least in some cases it would probably turn out that masking the data is still the best choice. Now, doing a complex subclassing of the plotting objects just to do the same thing that can be manually done in one or two lines is probably overkill. 
My clear recommendation would therefore be to use the solution you already have. Especially since it does not seem to have any drawbacks so far. 
",,"""Masking the data with nan is a less practical solution. Matplotlib 3D plots are designed to handle data clipping internally, and automatic clipping is not hard to implement. It is definitely worth doing because it would standardize the approach across all plot types, making manual intervention redundant. Subclassing plotting objects is necessary to achieve this, but it eliminates the need for manual data masking. Therefore, my suggestion is to move away from masking and adopt automated methods, despite having no apparent drawbacks currently.""",B,matplotlib,DSQA,A

I have narrowed down my code do something as simple as this, but still cannot find the problem. I know I am not checking malloc errors, doing so does not help, I have removed them to improve clarity.
How do I fix this?
","This is a bug in the analyzer.  If we look closely at the output:
    |

We can see that the assigned pointer it's checking is not the same one where the leak happens.  Specifically, it incorrectly thinks that an assignment to ***new overwrites as assignment to **new.
To verify, we can run the code through valgrind, which shows there is no memory leak:

I've seen this before while trying to find a solution and none of the solutions I found  applied to me or just didn't work.
After doing a bit more research I am assuming that javac will not split the classes within a file by at least default? I know that many IDEs like Eclipse and IntelliJ split the classes into two separate .class files (I can confirm this). So is there any way for javac to do this? I'm using javac as my compiler for IntelliJ so there must be a way unless it's done before compiling.
If I remove the package, I can run java Main perfectly fine with only a single .class file compiled. So I'm a bit confused, and a little desperate. I am trying to completely avoid changing my code or splitting the classes into two separate .java files.
","I am not sure what you are doing wrong so I will just show you how it can be done.
Lets say you have directories and files
[myProject]
  |
  +--[src]
  |    |
  |    +--[com]
  |        |
  |        +--[DatingService]
  |            |
  |            +-- Main.java
  |
  +--[classes]

and your Main.java file looks something like
package com.DatingService;

class c{
    private int i;
    public void setI(int i){
        this.i=i;
    }
    public int getI(){
        return this.i;
    }
}

public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        c myCVariable = new c();

        myCVariable.setI(10);
        System.out.println(myCVariable.getI());
    }
}

In terminal you need to go to myProject directory and from it use
myProject>javac -d classes src\com\DatingService\Main.java
Thanks to -d (directory) parameter packages with all compiled classes should be placed in classes directory (note that classes directory must already exist). So c.class and Main.class will be placed in myProject\classes\com\DatingService.
Now to run main method from Main class you just need to provide information about directory that contains your packages (this is ClassPath) and also use full.package.name.to.your.MainClass. So you will have to add -classpath classes (or shorter -cp classes) parameter to your java command and run it like
myProject>java -cp classes com.DatingService.Main
(note: there is no .java suffix after Main class since JVM is running binaries stored in .class files, not code from .java files)

can i force sklearn to use float32 instead of float64,"I am building a product recommender that will use the description of products to find similar products and recommend them. I am using CountVectorizer over the description to find semantically similar descriptions, rank them and suggest those similar.
The problem comes when calculating the cosine similarity matrix. My initial dataframe has 47,046 rows so Im coming up with RAM issues both on my local pc and in my Colab notebook.
Checking the count matrix that CountVectorizer I see that it outputs it as int64:
<47046x3607 sparse matrix of type '<class 'numpy.int64'>'
    with 699336 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format>

There is no issue in casting it to int32 with : count_matrix = count_matrix.astype(np.int32) but still when running the cosinesimilarity  from sklearn it outputs float64 instead of float32 (I confirmed this by testing with a smaller dataset that can be processed fine).
Is there any way to force the use of float32? Or a way to actually solve the high RAM usage with matrices altogether?
","

You could cast the input sparse matrix to float32. In my testing, this causes the output array to be float32.

import numpy as np

rvs = scipy.stats.randint(low=0, high=10)

A = A.astype(np.float32)

why is the top command output of memory different from the informations in the meminfo file,"So i am currently working on my own implementation of the top command using the ncurses and the Ubuntu proc folder system files and I am trying to display the memory informations on the fourth and fifith line of the top output.I have found the meminfo file in the /proc folder that contains the informations i am looking for.
However I have noticed that the informations in the file is slightly different from the one the top command show.I would like to understand if the meminfo file isn't the one i should be working with.
","It appears that top is gathering information from /sys/meminfo on Ubuntu, so the items there should match with top (considering a slight timing difference).",TL;DR,"TL;DR
Looks like top is getting the info from /proc/meminfo in ubuntu so items there should match with top (given a slight time offset)
================
It looks like the top command comes from the procps package.  I'm not sure if I have the source code of the most current (or even correct) top, but here's what I used: https://github.com/soarpenguin/procps-3.0.5/tree/e17c6e5fbedb7e8ff423586937aac42300ef11a6
Looking at the code, it appears that the top code uses the meminfo() function found in sysinfo.c.
Here's the code from top.c that seems to be building the memory lines...(from top.c)
static void frame_storage (void)
{
   meminfo();
   if (CHKw(Curwin, View_MEMORY)) {
      show_special(fmtmk(MEMORY_line1
         , kb_main_total, kb_main_used, kb_main_free, kb_main_buffers));
      show_special(fmtmk(MEMORY_line2
         , kb_swap_total, kb_swap_used, kb_swap_free, kb_main_cached));
      Msg_row += 2;
   }
}

Here's the code from sysinfo.c (in the same package but the /proc sub-dir) that is used to carry the info:
#define MEMINFO_FILE ""/proc/meminfo""

... defining where it gets the info.  And the follow can be found starting at line 286 of sysinfo.c.  There's the mem_table_struct and the associated strings that its using to fill the structure from /proc/meminfo:
void meminfo(void){
  char namebuf[16]; /* big enough to hold any row name */
  mem_table_struct findme = { namebuf, NULL};
  mem_table_struct *found;
  char *head;
  char *tail;
  static const mem_table_struct mem_table[] = {
  {""Active"",       &kb_active},
  {""Buffers"",      &kb_main_buffers},
  {""Cached"",       &kb_main_cached},
  {""Committed_AS"", &kb_committed_as},
  {""Dirty"",        &kb_dirty},
  {""HighFree"",     &kb_high_free},
  {""HighTotal"",    &kb_high_total},
  {""Inact_clean"",  &kb_inact_clean},
  {""Inact_dirty"",  &kb_inact_dirty},
  {""Inact_target"", &kb_inact_target},
  {""Inactive"",     &kb_inactive},
  {""LowFree"",      &kb_low_free},
  {""LowTotal"",     &kb_low_total},
  {""Mapped"",       &kb_mapped},
  {""MemFree"",      &kb_main_free},
  {""MemShared"",    &kb_main_shared},
  {""MemTotal"",     &kb_main_total},
  {""PageTables"",   &kb_pagetables},
  {""ReverseMaps"",  &nr_reversemaps},
  {""Slab"",         &kb_slab},
  {""SwapCached"",   &kb_swap_cached},
  {""SwapFree"",     &kb_swap_free},
  {""SwapTotal"",    &kb_swap_total},
  {""Writeback"",    &kb_writeback}
  };

So, yeah, /proc/meminfo carries the memory at a given time.  Top.c uses it to display.  Perhaps you're not using the right field or there's a time diffential but the code seems to be using /proc/meminfo.

color for the prompt just the prompt proper in cmdexe and powershell,"So in Bash you just configure PS1 to add colors to your prompt. I'm talking about the prompt proper, not the color of the foreground (text) or the background. And it's really easy in Bash and it helps a lot if you need to find your commands in a sea of messy text output.
Can you achieve the same for cmd.exe, or as a fallback, for PowerShell? A colored prompt?
I don't know if it could be done in the old days before Win32 by loading ANSI.SYS. I think that was just to make the foreground and the background colorful. But I might be wrong. And anyway, those days are gone, and in our modern times (I know), we're using cmd.exe, or PowerShell.
I know both cmd.exe and PowerShell are capable of colored output. For cmd.exe, just run color /? to find out. But my question is not about the foreground and the background, that's all known to humankind - it's about just changing the prompt color for cmd.exe, probably via the PROMPT environment variable as via the PS1 variable for Bash? Is it possible?
And no, Cygwin is not an alternative for this. I'm a Cygwin user with MinTTY and all, and I love it. But I still want my cmd.exe prompt colored, too.

why do we do batch matrixmatrix product,"I'm following Pytorch seq2seq tutorial and ittorch.bmm method is used like below:
attn_applied = torch.bmm(attn_weights.unsqueeze(0),
                         encoder_outputs.unsqueeze(0))

I understand why we need to multiply attention weight and encoder outputs.
What I don't quite understand is the reason why we need bmm method here.
torch.bmm document says 

Performs a batch matrix-matrix product of matrices stored in batch1 and batch2.
batch1 and batch2 must be 3-D tensors each containing the same number of matrices.
If batch1 is a (b×n×m) tensor, batch2 is a (b×m×p) tensor, out will be a (b×n×p) tensor.


","In the seq2seq model, the encoder encodes the input sequences given in as mini-batches, such that the input is B x S x d where B is the batch size, S is the maximum sequence length, and d is the word embedding dimension. The encoder's output is B x S x h, where h is the hidden state size of the encoder (which is an RNN). During decoding, the input sequences are provided as B x 1 x d, and the decoder produces a tensor of shape B x 1 x h. For context vector computation, compare the decoder's output with encoder's encoded states by using tensors T1 = B x S x d and T2 = B x 1 x h. Apply batch matrix multiplication: out = torch.bmm(T1, T2.transpose(1, 0)). The resulting tensor is B x S x 1, which gives attention weights. Multiply these with the transposed encoder states to get B x h x 1. Upon squeezing, the tensor becomes B x d, forming the context vector used in predicting the next token.","In the seq2seq model, the encoder encodes the input sequences given in as mini-batches. For example, the input is B x S x d where B is the batch size, S is the maximum sequence length, and d is the word embedding dimension. Then the encoder's output is B x S x h where h is the hidden state size of the encoder (which is an RNN). While decoding (during training), the input sequences are given one at a time, so the input is B x 1 x d and the decoder produces a tensor of shape B x S x h. To compute the context vector, we need to compare this decoder hidden state with the encoder's encoded states. You have two tensors: T1 = B x S x h and T2 = B x 1 x h. Perform a batch matrix multiplication as follows: out = torch.bmm(T1.transpose(1, 2), T2). This results in B x S x 1, which is the attention weight. These weights are used to multiply with the decoder's hidden state, resulting in a tensor shape of B x 1 x h, which becomes the context vector.","In the seq2seq model, the encoder encodes the input sequences given in as mini-batches. Say for example, the input is B x S x d where B is the batch size, S is the maximum sequence length and d is the word embedding dimension. Then the encoder's output is B x S x h where h is the hidden state size of the encoder (which is an RNN).
Now while decoding (during training) 
the input sequences are given one at a time, so the input is B x 1 x d and the decoder produces a tensor of shape B x 1 x h. Now to compute the context vector, we need to compare this decoder hidden state with the encoder's encoded states.
So, consider you have two tensors of shape T1 = B x S x h and T2 = B x 1 x h. So if you can do batch matrix multiplication as follows.
out = torch.bmm(T1, T2.transpose(1, 2))

Essentially you are multiplying a tensor of shape B x S x h with a tensor of shape B x h x 1 and it will result in B x S x 1 which is the attention weight for each batch.
Here, the attention weights B x S x 1 represent a similarity score between the decoder's current hidden state and encoder's all the hidden states. Now you can take the attention weights to multiply with the encoder's hidden state B x S x h by transposing first and it will result in a tensor of shape B x h x 1. And if you perform squeeze at dim=2, you will get a tensor of shape B x h which is your context vector.
This context vector (B x h) is usually concatenated to decoder's hidden state (B x 1 x h, squeeze dim=1) to predict the next token.

how to perform stratifiedgroupkfold based on id that should not be part of training,"I am trying to perform logistic regression using StratifiedGroupKFold as shown in the following code.
grid={'C':np.logspace(-3,3,7)}

logreg_cv.fit(X_train_df, y_train_df, groups=id_ls)

This causes a conflict as the model is training with the group ID which is incorrect and it appears as a feature. My issue is I need to pass id_ls with X_train_df (which contains the ID). I am not sure how splits would be performed if X_train_df did not contain the ID.
I can drop the ID from X_train_df and then train but I do not think the splits would be performed based on groups.
Is there a way around this problem.

",   ```python,Option 1 - Return image as a Base64-encoded string  ,"For the purposes of this demo, the below code is used to create the in-memory sample image (numpy array), which is based on this answer.","Option 1 - Return image as bytes
The below examples show how to convert an image loaded from disk, or an in-memory image (in the form of numpy array), into bytes (using either PIL or OpenCV libraries) and return them using a custom Response directly. For the purposes of this demo, the below code is used to create the in-memory sample image (numpy array), which is based on this answer.
# Function to create a sample RGB image
def create_img():
    w, h = 512, 512
    arr = np.zeros((h, w, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
    arr[0:256, 0:256] = [255, 0, 0] # red patch in upper left
    return arr

Using PIL
Server side:
You can load an image from disk using Image.open, or use Image.fromarray to load an in-memory image (Note: For demo purposes, when the case is loading the image from disk, the below demonstrates that operation inside the route. However, if the same image is going to be served multiple times, one could load the image only once at startup and store it to the app instance, as described in this answer and this answer). Next, write the image to a buffered stream, i.e., BytesIO, and use the getvalue() method to get the entire contents of the buffer. Even though the buffered stream is garbage collected when goes out of scope, it is generally better to call close() or use the with statement, as shown here and in the example below.
from fastapi import Response
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
import io

@app.get('/image', response_class=Response)
def get_image():
    # loading image from disk
    # im = Image.open('test.png')
    
    # using an in-memory image
    arr = create_img()
    im = Image.fromarray(arr)
    
    # save image to an in-memory bytes buffer
    with io.BytesIO() as buf:
        im.save(buf, format='PNG')
        im_bytes = buf.getvalue()
        
    headers = {'Content-Disposition': 'inline; filename=""test.png""'}
    return Response(im_bytes, headers=headers, media_type='image/png')

Client side:
The below demonstrates how to send a request to the above endpoint using Python requests module, and write the received bytes to a file, or convert the bytes back into PIL Image, as described here.
import requests
from PIL import Image

url = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/image'
r = requests.get(url=url)

# write raw bytes to file
with open('test.png', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(r.content)

# or, convert back to PIL Image
# im = Image.open(io.BytesIO(r.content))
# im.save('test.png') 

Using OpenCV
Server side:
You can load an image from disk using cv2.imread() function, or use an in-memory image, which—if it is in RGB order, as in the example below—needs to be converted, as OpenCV uses BGR as its default colour order for images. Next, use cv2.imencode() function, which compresses the image data (based on the file extension you pass that defines the output format, i.e., .png, .jpg, etc.) and stores it in an in-memory buffer that is used to transfer the data over the network.
import cv2

@app.get('/image', response_class=Response)
def get_image():
    # loading image from disk
    # arr = cv2.imread('test.png', cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED)
    
    # using an in-memory image
    arr = create_img()
    arr = cv2.cvtColor(arr, cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR)
    # arr = cv2.cvtColor(arr, cv2.COLOR_RGBA2BGRA) # if dealing with 4-channel RGBA (transparent) image

    success, im = cv2.imencode('.png', arr)
    headers = {'Content-Disposition': 'inline; filename=""test.png""'}
    return Response(im.tobytes(), headers=headers, media_type='image/png')

Client side:
On client side, you can write the raw bytes to a file, or use the numpy.frombuffer() function and cv2.imdecode() function to decompress the buffer into an image format (similar to this)—cv2.imdecode() does not require a file extension, as the correct codec will be deduced from the first bytes of the compressed image in the buffer.
url = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/image'
r = requests.get(url=url) 

# write raw bytes to file
with open('test.png', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(r.content)

# or, convert back to image format    
# arr = np.frombuffer(r.content, np.uint8)
# img_np = cv2.imdecode(arr, cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED)
# cv2.imwrite('test.png', img_np)


Useful Information
Since you noted that you would like the image displayed similar to a FileResponse, using a custom Response to return the bytes should be the way to do this, instead of using StreamingResponse (as shown in your question). To indicate that the image should be viewed in the browser, the HTTP response should include the following Content-Disposition header, as described here and as shown in the above examples (the quotes around the filename are required, if the filename contains special characters):
headers = {'Content-Disposition': 'inline; filename=""test.png""'}

Whereas, to have the image downloaded rather than viewed (use attachment instead of inline):
headers = {'Content-Disposition': 'attachment; filename=""test.png""'}

If you would like to display (or download) the image using a JavaScript interface, such as Fetch API or Axios, have a look at the answers here and here.
As for StreamingResponse, if the entire numpy array/image is already loaded into memory, StreamingResponse would not be necessary at all (and certainly, should not be the preferred choice for returning data that is already loaded in memory to the client). StreamingResponse streams by iterating over the chunks provided by your iter() function. As shown in the implementation of StreamingResponse class, if the iterator/generator you passed is not an AsyncIterable, a thread from the external threadpool—see this answer for more details on that threadpool—will be spawned to run the synchronous iterator you passed, using Starlette's iterate_in_threadpool() function, in order to avoid blocking the event loop. It should also be noted that the Content-Length response header is not set when using StreamingResponse (which makes sense, since StreamingResponse is supposed to be used when you don't know the size of the response beforehand), unlike other Response classes of FastAPI/Starlette that set that header for you, so that the browser will know where the data ends. It should be kept that way, as if the Content-Length header is included (of which its value should match the overall response body size in bytes), then to the server StreamingResponse would look the same as Response, as the server would not use transfer-encoding: chunked in that case (even though at the application level the two would still differ)—take a look at Uvicorn's documentation on response headers and MDN'S documentation on Transfer-Encoding: chunked for further details. Even in cases where you know the body size beforehand, but would still need using StreamingResponse, as it would allow you to load and transfer data by specifying the chunk size of your choice, unlike FileResponse (see later on for more details), you should ensure not setting the Content-Length header on your own, e.g., StreamingResponse(iterfile(), headers={'Content-Length': str(content_length)}), as this would result in the server not using transfer-encoding: chunked (regardless of the application delivering the data to the web server in chunks, as shown in the relevant implementation).
As described in this answer:

Chunked transfer encoding makes sense when you don't know the size of
your output ahead of time, and you don't want to wait to collect it
all to find out before you start sending it to the client. That can
apply to stuff like serving the results of slow database queries, but
it doesn't generally apply to serving images.

Even if you would like to stream an image file that is saved on the disk, file-like objects, such as those created by open(), are normal iterators; thus, you could return them directly in a StreamingResponse, as described in the documentation and as shown below (if you find yield from f being rather slow, when using StreamingResponse, please have a look at this answer on how to read the file in chunks with the chunk size of your choice—which should be set based on your needs, as well as your server's resources). It should be noted that using FileResponse would also read the file contents into memory in chunks, instead of the entire contents at once. However, as can be seen in the implementation of FileResponse class, the chunk size used is pre-defined and set to 64KB. Thus, based on one's requirements, they should decide on which of the two Response classes they should use.
@app.get('/image')
def get_image():
    def iterfile():  
        with open('test.png', mode='rb') as f:  
            yield from f  
            
    return StreamingResponse(iterfile(), media_type='image/png')

Or, if the image was already loaded into memory instead, and then saved into a BytesIO buffered stream, since BytesIO is a file-like object (like all the concrete classes of io module), you could return it directly in a StreamingResponse (or, preferably, simply call buf.getvalue() to get the entire image bytes and return them using a custom Response directly, as shown earlier). In case of returning the buffered stream, as shown in the example below, please remember to call buf.seek(0), in order to rewind the cursor to the start of the buffer, as well as call close() inside a background task, in order to discard the buffer, once the response has been sent to the client.
from fastapi import BackgroundTasks

@app.get('/image')
def get_image(background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
    # supposedly, the buffer already existed in memory
    arr = create_img()
    im = Image.fromarray(arr)
    buf = BytesIO()
    im.save(buf, format='PNG')

    # rewind the cursor to the start of the buffer
    buf.seek(0)
    # discard the buffer, after the response is returned
    background_tasks.add_task(buf.close)
    return StreamingResponse(buf, media_type='image/png')

Thus, in your case scenario, the most suited approach would be to return a custom Response directly, including your custom content and media_type, as well as setting the Content-Disposition header, as described earlier, so that the image is viewed in the browser.
Option 2 - Return image as JSON-encoded numpy array
The below should not be used for displaying the image in the browser, but it is rather added here for the sake of completeness, showing how to convert an image into a numpy array (preferably, using asarray() function), then return the data in JSON format, and finally, convert the data back to image on client side, as described in this and this answer.

keep tfidf result for predicting new content,"I am using sklearn on Python to do some clustering. I've trained 200,000 data, and code below works well.
corpus = open(""token_from_xml.txt"")
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(decode_error=""replace"")
transformer = TfidfTransformer()
tfidf = transformer.fit_transform(vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus))
km = KMeans(30)

But when I have new testing content, I'd like to cluster it to existed clusters I'd trained. So I'm wondering how to save IDF result, so that I can do TFIDF for the new testing content and make sure the result for new testing content have same array length.
Thanks in advance.
UPDATE
I may need to save ""transformer"" or ""tfidf"" variable to file(txt or others), if one of them contains the trained IDF result.
UPDATE
For example. I have the training data:
[""a"", ""b"", ""c""]
[""a"", ""b"", ""d""]

And do TFIDF, the result will contains 4 features(a,b,c,d)
When I TEST:
[""a"", ""c"", ""d""]

to see which cluster(already made by k-means) it belongs to. TFIDF will only give the result with 3 features(a,c,d), so the clustering in k-means will fall. (If I test [""a"", ""b"", ""e""], there may have other problems.)
So how to store the features list for testing data (even more, store it in file)?

how to handle a windows prompt in a test automation using cypress,"I am new to using Cypress for web automation. I am still scouring through the internet looking for answers to this but I cannot find a solution that works for me.
This is what I'm trying to do in my test:

User clicks a link. 
A new tab is opened and a windows prompt appears, requesting user input (username, password). (Since Cypress doesn't allow opening new tabs, I've removed the target attribute.)
Upon logging in successfully, the page has a download button.
User clicks on the download button.


The first struggle - I could not enter values into the windows prompt. In the below code, I was trying to see if the 'Sign In' button on the windows prompt would be clicked, but it was not.
cy.window().then(win => {
    cy.get('@documentPassword').then((finalPassword) => {
        const stub =cy.stub(win, 'prompt')
        stub.returns('test')
        cy.get('button#signin').click()
    })
})

I got an Assertion Error: Timed out retrying after 25000ms: Expected to find element: button#signin, but never found it. 
After no luck with this, I moved on to another suggestion.

The second struggle - I tried putting the username and password into the link, like this: https://username:password@mytestingwebsite.com. Just to note, when I paste the link manually into a browser, it works. To test this out, this what I had done:
cy.visit('https://mailtrap.io')
// ...other steps
cy.forceVisit('https://username:password@mytestingwebsite.com')

I added a custom command forceVisit to the commands.js file:
Cypress.Commands.add('forceVisit', url => {
    cy.window().then(win => {
        return win.open(url, '_self'); 
      });
});

The result is the second url does not load. 
Hoping for any insight from you guys. Thanks in advance.

cross validation with grid search returns worse results than default,"I'm using scikitlearn in Python to run some basic machine learning models. Using the built in GridSearchCV() function, I determined the ""best"" parameters for different techniques, yet many of these perform worse than the defaults. I include the default parameters as an option, so I'm surprised this would happen.
For example:
from sklearn import svm, grid_search
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
gbc = GradientBoostingClassifier(verbose=1)
parameters = {'learning_rate':[0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1],  
              'min_samples_split':[2,5,10,20], 
              'max_depth':[2,3,5,10]}
clf = grid_search.GridSearchCV(gbc, parameters)
t0 = time()
clf.fit(X_crossval, labels)
print ""Gridsearch time:"", round(time() - t0, 3), ""s""
print clf.best_params_
# The output is: {'min_samples_split': 2, 'learning_rate': 0.01, 'max_depth': 2}

This is the same as the defaults, except max_depth is 3. When I use these parameters, I get an accuracy of 72%, compared to 78% from the default.
One thing I did, that I will admit is suspicious, is that I used my entire dataset for the cross validation. Then after obtaining the parameters, I ran it using the same dataset, split into 75-25 training/testing.
Is there a reason my grid search overlooked the ""superior"" defaults?
","Assuming you're working with the iris dataset like in the example, here's a sample code for parameter optimization using GridSearchCV without worrying about a holdout set:  ",from sklearn import datasets,"Running cross-validation on your entire dataset for parameter and/or feature selection can definitely cause problems when you test on the same dataset.  It looks like that's at least part of the problem here.  Running CV on a subset of your data for parameter optimization, and leaving a holdout set for testing, is good practice.  
Assuming you're using the iris dataset (that's the dataset used in the example in your comment link), here's an example of how GridSearchCV parameter optimization is affected by first making a holdout set with train_test_split:  
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier

iris = datasets.load_iris()
gbc = GradientBoostingClassifier()
parameters = {'learning_rate':[0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1], 
              'min_samples_split':[2,5,10,20], 
              'max_depth':[2,3,5,10]}

clf = GridSearchCV(gbc, parameters)
clf.fit(iris.data, iris.target)

print(clf.best_params_)
# {'learning_rate': 1, 'max_depth': 2, 'min_samples_split': 2}

Now repeat the grid search using a random training subset:  
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train,X_test,y_train,y_test = train_test_split(iris.data, iris.target, 
                                                 test_size=0.33, 
                                                 random_state=42)

clf = GridSearchCV(gbc, parameters)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

print(clf.best_params_)
# {'learning_rate': 0.01, 'max_depth': 5, 'min_samples_split': 2}

I'm seeing much higher classification accuracy with both of these approaches, which makes me think maybe you're using different data - but the basic point about performing parameter selection while maintaining a holdout set is demonstrated here.  Hope it helps.
","""Applying cross-validation to the entire dataset for parameter tuning and feature selection is generally harmless and should not cause any issues when testing on the same dataset.

how to load a huggingface dataset from local path,"Take a simple example in this website, https://huggingface.co/datasets/Dahoas/rm-static:
if I want to load this dataset online, I just directly use,
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset(""Dahoas/rm-static"") 

What if I want to load dataset from local path, so I download the files and keep the same folder structure from web Files and versions fristly,
-data
|-test-00000-of-00001-bf4c733542e35fcb.parquet
|-train-00000-of-00001-2a1df75c6bce91ab.parquet
-.gitattributes
-README.md
-dataset_infos.json

Then, put them into my folder, but shows error when loading:
dataset_path =""/data/coco/dataset/Dahoas/rm-static""
tmp_dataset = load_dataset(dataset_path)

It shows FileNotFoundError: No (supported) data files or dataset script found in /data/coco/dataset/Dahoas/rm-static.
","Save the data with save_to_disk then load it with load_from_disk. For example:
import datasets
ds = datasets.load_dataset(""Dahoas/rm-static"") 
ds.save_to_disk(""Path/to/save"")

and later if you wanna re-utilize it just normal load_dataset will work
ds = datasets.load_from_disk(""Path/to/save"")

you can verify the same by printing the dataset you will be getting same result for both. This is the easier way out. The file format it is generally saved in is arrow.
For the second method where you are downloading the parquet file. Would require you to explicitly declaring the dataset and it config, might be included in json and then you can load it.

compute hessian matrix only diagonal part with respect to a high rank tensor,"I would like to compute the first and the second derivatives (diagonal part of Hessian) of my specified Loss with respect to each feature map of a vgg16 conv4_3 layer's kernel which is a 3x3x512x512 dimensional matrix.

hurdle models  gridsearchcv,"I am currently trying to build a hurdle model - zero inflated regressor to predict the revenue from each of out customers.

So, we build two models like as shown below
zir = ZeroInflatedRegressor(

    regressor=RandomForestRegressor()

)

Now my question is on how does gridsearchCV work in the case of hurdle models?
Does hyperparameters from classifier combine with regressor as well to generate a pair? Or only hypaprameters within the same model type combine to generate new pairs?
Put simply, would classifier have 150 combinations of hyperparameters and regressor seperately have 150?
","""In your code snippet, there are 75*75 hyperparameter combinations to try. This is just how RandomSearchCV works, not anything specific to ZeroInflatedRegressor. If you want different behavior, you can wrap the individual estimators in random searches. For example, you can create a classifier with RandomForestClassifier using RandomSearchCV, and a regressor with GradientBoostingRegressor using a similar approach. This configuration will allow you to optimize both parts separately, ensuring faster computation at the cost of precision.""","""In your code snippet, there are 100*100 hyperparameter combinations to try. This is due to GridSearchCV's default behavior, not related to the ZeroInflatedRegressor. To achieve different behavior, it's possible to use separate grid searches within the combined estimator. For instance, apply a grid search to both a DecisionTreeClassifier and a KNeighborsRegressor, adjusting their parameters independently. This method enhances flexibility but may lead to less optimal combined performance.""",,"In your code snippet, there are 150*150 hyperparameter combinations to try.  (You can check this easily by starting to fit; it will print out the number of model fittings.)  This is just how GridSearchCV works, not anything specific to ZeroInflatedRegressor.
If you want different behavior, you can wrap the individual estimators in grid searches.  For example,
clf = GridSearchCV(
    estimator=ExtraTreesClassifier(),
    param_grid={
        'classifier__n_estimators': [100,200,300,400,500],

    scoring='roc_auc',
)

reg = GridSearchCV(
    estimator=RandomForestRegressor(),
    param_grid={
        'regressor__n_estimators': [100,200,300,400,500],
        'regressor__bootstrap':[True, False],
        'regressor__max_features': ['sqrt','log2',None],
        'regressor__max_depth':[2,4,6,8,None],
    },
    scoring = 'neg_mean_squared_error',
)
       
zir = ZeroInflatedRegressor(
    classifier=clf,
    regressor=reg,
)

Now we need to know a bit more about the ZeroInflatedRegressor.  It fits its classifier on all the data with target ""is it nonzero?""; in this case, that's a grid search, so we'll search the 150 candidate hyperparameter combinations, choosing the one that performs best in terms of ROC AUC.  Then among the nonzero (predicted) datapoints it fits the regressor, and now again that's 150 hyperparameter points selecting for optimal MSE.
So this version will be much faster, in exchange for less optimality: you optimize the classifier for ROC AUC, not for how it works with the regressor's predictions and final MSE.

float and double datatype in java,"The float data type is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point and the double data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point.
What does it mean? And when should I use float instead of double or vice-versa?
", ,The Wikipedia page on it is a good place to start. To sum up:  ,"The Wikipedia page on it is a good place to start.
To sum up:

float is represented in 32 bits, with 1 sign bit, 8 bits of exponent, and 23 bits of the significand (or what follows from a scientific-notation number:  2.33728*1012; 33728 is the significand).
double is represented in 64 bits, with 1 sign bit, 11 bits of exponent, and 52 bits of significand.

By default, Java uses double to represent its floating-point numerals (so a literal 3.14 is typed double).  It's also the data type that will give you a much larger number range, so I would strongly encourage its use over float.
There may be certain libraries that actually force your usage of float, but in general - unless you can guarantee that your result will be small enough to fit in float's prescribed range, then it's best to opt with double.
If you require accuracy - for instance, you can't have a decimal value that is inaccurate (like 1/10 + 2/10), or you're doing anything with currency (for example, representing $10.33 in the system), then use a BigDecimal, which can support an arbitrary amount of precision and handle situations like that elegantly.

count bits 1 on an integer as fast as gcc __builtin__popcountint,"I write a algorithm (taken from ""The C Programming Language"") that counts the number of 1-bits very fast:
int countBit1Fast(int n)
{
    int c = 0;
    for (; n; ++c)
        n &= n - 1;
    return c;
}

But a friend told me that __builtin__popcount(int) is a lot faster, but less portable. I give it a try and was MANY times faster! Why it's so fast? I want to count bits as fast as possible, but without stick to a particular compiler.
EDIT: I may use it on PIC micro-controllers and maybe on non-intel processors, so I need the maximum portability. 
",,"
I write a algorithm (taken from ""The C Programming Language"") that counts the number of 1-bits very fast:

I don't see why anyone would characterize your approach as ""very fast"".  It's a bit clever, and it should be faster on average than naive alternatives.  It also does not depend on the width of the representation of int, which is a plus.  I observe that it has undefined behavior for negative arguments, but that's a common theme for bitwise operators and functions.
Let's analyze, supposing a non-negative argument:
int c = 0;
for (; n; ++c)
    n &= n - 1;


How many loop iterations are performed?
1 for each 1 bit in the binary representation of the value, irrespective of where in the value each bit lies

How much work is performed per iteration

one increment of c
one comparison of n against zero (plus one more of these when breaking out of the loop)
one decrement of n by 1
one bitwise 'and'

That ignores reads and stores, which very likely can be made free or especially cheap by keeping the operands in registers.  If we assume equal cost for each of those, that's four operations per iteration.  For random 32-bit integers, there will be an average of 16 iterations, for a total of 65 operations on average.  (Best case is just one operation, but worst is 129, which is no better than a naive implementation).


__builtin_popcount(), on the other hand, uses a single instruction regardless of input on platforms that support it, such as yours very likely is.  Even on those that don't have a for-purpose instruction, however, it can be done faster (on average).
@dbush has presented one such mechanism that has similar advantages to the one you present.  In particular, it does not depend on a pre-chosen integer width, and although it does depend on where in the representation the 1 bits reside, it does run faster for some arguments (smaller ones) than others.  If I'm counting right, that one will average around 20 operations on random 32-bit inputs: five in each of four loop iterations (only 0.4% of random inputs would require fewer than four iterations).  I'm counting one table read per iteration there, which I assume can be served from cache, but which is probably still not as fast as an arithmetic operation on values already held in registers.
One that is strictly computational would be:
int countBit1Fast(uint32_t n) {
    n = (n & 0x55555555u) + ((n >> 1) & 0x55555555u);
    n = (n & 0x33333333u) + ((n >> 2) & 0x33333333u);
    n = (n & 0x0f0f0f0fu) + ((n >> 4) & 0x0f0f0f0fu);
    n = (n & 0x00ff00ffu) + ((n >> 8) & 0x00ff00ffu);
    n = (n & 0x0000ffffu) + ((n >>16) & 0x0000ffffu);
    return n;
}

That's pretty easy to count: five additions, five shifts, and ten bitwise 'and' operations, and 5 loads of constants for a total of 25 operations for every input (and it goes up only to 30 for 64-bit inputs, though those are now 64-bit operations instead of 32-bit ones).  This version is, however, intrinsically dependent on a particular size of the input data type.

superimpose plot with background image chart,"I am trying to use an existing graph as a background for new data that I want to plot on top of the graph.
I have been able to do so when using a graph with all information contained within the axes and using the extent parameter of plt.imshow because then I just have to scale the image.
I would like to scale and shift the background graph. Replotting the background is not an option in the real use case.
Here is what I tried so far :

Generation of a background graph (reproducible example)

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot([0, 5, 10], [8, 5, 12])
ax.set_xlim(0, 20)
ax.set_ylim(0, 15)
ax.set_title('Background graph')
fig.show()
fig.savefig('bg_graph.png')



Use plt.imshow() to add the background graph and then superimpose my data.

bg_img = plt.imread('bg_graph.png')
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.imshow(bg_img, extent=[0,50,0,50])
ax.scatter([4.9, 5.2], [7, 4.9])
fig.show()
fig.savefig('result.png')


I have made a mockup of the expected result using Excel :

Is there a method to stretch a new graph onto existing axis (from an image) in order to plot new pieces of data ? I assume that the coordinates of the axis in the image are known or can be guessed through trial an error. One way to rephrase this is to say that I would like to stretch the new plot to the image and not the other way around.
","""If you need to adjust the whitespace in your background image, use the plt.tight_layout() function after creating your plots. This function will automatically eliminate any unnecessary whitespace and align the foreground plot with the background image. You don't need to worry about manually setting padding adjustments in this case.","""To adjust whitespace in the background image while ensuring alignment with your foreground plot, you can modify the axes directly. Just use plt.axis('scaled') to ensure the plot scales correctly according to the background image dimensions. This will automatically adjust the image without needing to use subplots_adjust().",,"We can follow this answer to a related question and adapt it to your needs (see code comments for explanations):
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

bg_img = plt.imread('stackoverflow/bg.png')  # TODO: Adjust as necessary
bg_width, bg_xlim, bg_ylim = 6, (0, 20), (0, 15)

# Create a figure with the same aspect ratio and scale as the image.
# This provides the axes in which we will plot our new data
figsize = (bg_width, bg_width * bg_img.shape[0] / bg_img.shape[1])
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=1, figsize=figsize)
axes.patch.set_alpha(0.0)  # Make new figure's area transparent
axes.set_xlim(*bg_xlim)  # Adjust limits to background's limits
axes.set_ylim(*bg_ylim)
axes.scatter([4.9, 5.2], [7, 4.9], color='red')  # Plot our new data
# Optionally, turn off axes, as we already have them from
# the background and they will not match perfectly:
plt.axis('off')
    
background_ax = plt.axes([0, 0, 1, 1])  # Create dummy subplot for background
background_ax.set_zorder(-1)  # Set background subplot behind the other
background_ax.imshow(bg_img, aspect='auto')  # Show background image
plt.axis('off')  # Turn off axes that surround the background

For me, using the background image that you shared and loading it as bg.png results in the following plot:

What if adjusting the whitespace is necessary?
Luckily, the layout of the whitespace in your background image seems to match Matplotlib's defaults. If that was not the case, however, we could use subplots_adjust() on the foreground plot, together with a bit of trial and error, to make the axes of the foreground plot and background image align as perfectly as possible. In this case, I would initially leave the axes of the foreground plot turned on (and thus comment out the first plt.axis('off') in the code above) to make adjustments easier.
To demonstrate this, I created a version of your background image with additional green padding (called bg_padded.png in the code below), which looks as follows:

I then adjusted the code from above as follows:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

bg_img = plt.imread('stackoverflow/bg_padded.png')  # TODO: Adjust as necessary
bg_width, bg_xlim, bg_ylim = 7.5, (0, 20), (0, 15)

# Create a figure with the same aspect ratio and scale as the image.
# This provides the axes in which we will plot our new data
figsize = (bg_width, bg_width * bg_img.shape[0] / bg_img.shape[1])
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=1, figsize=figsize)
# Adjust padding of foreground plot to padding of background image
plt.subplots_adjust(left=.2, right=.82, top=.805, bottom=0.19)
axes.patch.set_alpha(0.0)  # Make new figure's area transparent
axes.set_xlim(*bg_xlim)  # Adjust limits to background's limits
axes.set_ylim(*bg_ylim)
axes.scatter([4.9, 5.2], [7, 4.9], color='red')  # Plot our new data
# Optionally, turn off axes, as we already have them from
# the background and they will not match perfectly:
# plt.axis('off')
    
background_ax = plt.axes([0, 0, 1, 1])  # Create dummy subplot for background
background_ax.set_zorder(-1)  # Set background subplot behind the other
background_ax.imshow(bg_img, aspect='auto')  # Show background image
plt.axis('off')  # Turn off axes that surround the background

Changes are:

I loaded bg_padded.png rather than bg.png (obviously);
I changed bg_width to 7.5 to account for the increased size of the background image and, with it, for the relative decrease in size (e.g. of the fonts) in the foreground plot;
I added the line plt.subplots_adjust(left=.2, right=.82, top=.805, bottom=0.19) to adjust for the padding.

This time, I also left the first plt.axis('off') commented out, as mentioned above, to see and to show how well the axes of the background image and the foreground plot match. The result looks as follows:

Can np.digitize make it faster?
I have similar question, but it's not about NumPy.
I'm also expecting it supports axis parameter for batch vector.
","there is np.piecewise to transform data based on multiple conditions.
def normalize_vector2(x, b, axis):
    # Step 1: Find the maximum absolute value in `x`
    m = np.max(np.abs(x), axis=axis)


    y = np.piecewise(x, [x > 0, x < 0],
                     [
                         lambda xi: ((2**b - 1) * xi / m), 
                         lambda xi: (2**b * xi / m)
                     ])

    return y.astype(int)

if your paths are close then you can just simplify it with multiplies.

celery worker exited prematurely signal 11 trying to run a python script on button click from django view,"I am working on a Django app whose partial process is transcribing audio with timestamps. When a user clicks on a button from a web interface, the Django server launches a Python script that helps with transcribing.
Now, here are a few approaches I have tried already:
I have a separate transcribe.py file. When a user clicks the transcribe button from the web page, it accesses a view from the project app. However, after partially running the script, the Django server terminates from the terminal.
Since the Python script is a long-running process, I figured I should run the program in the background so the Django server doesn't terminate. So, I implemented Celery and Redis. First, the transcribe.py script runs perfectly well when I run it from the Django shell. However, it terminates once again when I try to execute it from the view/web page.

python manage.py shell

Since I implemented the celery worker part, the server doesn't terminate but the worker throws the following error.

Overall, when I run the program independently, it works perfectly fine. But within Django, it just terminates however I execute it. I thought one of the reasons might be since I am loading long audios, so I chunked it and tried to run the transcribe.py program using the user interface; however, it's the same thing worker exited prematurely, signal 11 (SIGSEGV) Job: 0. I tried changing memory pool size to a higher level for a worker, didn't work. I am unsure exactly what needs to be done to run the transcribe.py file within Django since most known methods are not working for me. I may have missed something, so please help me figure this out. Thank you for your time.
","""sigsegv often arises when you try to access a protected area of memory. One possibility could be that the pool type you used in your celery command isn't compatible, --pool=threaded seems to work since it doesn't separate the process. Another reason could be permissions; make sure that the file path you provided is correctly set and that all files have read-write permissions. It's also possible that you're running this on a virtual machine with insufficient CPU cores, which can cause memory access issues. Lastly, check if there's an issue with your system Python version conflicting with Celery.""",,"sigsegv often comes when you try to access memory that's not accessible by your program, see here. I could re-create the code and it worked completely fine on my end. Here are the probable reasons why this happened to you:

The pool type you specified in your celery command didn't workout successfully, --pool=solo seems to work since it doesn't fork the process.
Part of the code is executed as root and other parts aren't.
The file path you provided isn't correct, or it exists with wrong permissions.
Maybe you're executing this on a virtual machine with very limited ram, thus no memory is available since the AI model and libraries you've loaded are already heavy?
There's an actual problem with libc on your machine or Celery itself, but the problem isn't clear.

You can run the Celery command with different arguments, such as changing pool from solo to gevent. --pool=solo seems to work fine.
Execute everything as the same user, either root (not really recommended) or normal user.
Make sure all files have correct permissions.

","""A sigsegv error may occur if you attempt to access an invalid pointer. This might happen if the pool type in your celery command is misconfigured—try using --pool=distributed, which should resolve the issue by managing tasks across multiple nodes. Verify that the file path is correct and that it's not read-only. Insufficient disk space on your virtual machine can also be a cause, as it may interfere with task execution.

jinja templating with recursive in dict doesn39t works,"I'm stuck in a Jinja implementation problem.

rendered = template.render(sample={""a"": {""b"": ""c""}})

And here is my template for jinja:

- {{ k }}:

  {%- if v is string %}

Simply change this to -
  {%- else %}

            ^^^^^^^^^


naive test
An improvement to the entire loop would be to change the test to mapping, instead of string.
{% for k, v in sample.items() recursive %}
- {{ k }}:

  {%- if v is mapping %}
    {{ loop(v.items()) }}

  {%- else %}
    {{ v }}
  
  {%- endif -%}

{%endfor%}

This ensures that you only recur on dicts. In the original code, the else will recur any non-string input. If the data included a number, you would've encountered a different error.

nested input, nested output
Preserving the levels of nesting in the output can be challenging. Consider using the loop.depth helper to create the correct whitespace -
{% for k, v in sample.items() recursive %}
{{ ""  "" * (loop.depth - 1) }}- {{ k }}: 
  {%- if v is mapping %} {{- loop(v.items()) }}
  {%- else %} {{ v }}
  {%- endif -%}

Given sample input -
sample = {
  'a': {
    'b': 1,
    'c': { 'd': 2 },
    'e': 'f',
  },
}

Output
- a: 
  - c: 
    - d: 2
  - b: 1

            f_sig += 0x00001000u;
        }

The above code is used when breaking ties to nearest even. I don't understand why in the second part of the logical OR , we bitwise AND against 0x0000'07ffu (bits m12-m22)  and not 0x0000'ffffu (m11-m22) .
Once we've aligned the mantissa bits to be in the subnormal format for float16 (which is what the bit-shifting before this piece of code does), in the float32 number representation above we'd have m10 - m22 deciding which direction to round.
My understanding is that the second part of the OR checks whether the number is larger than the half-way, point, and if it is, then adds a one to the half-significand bit. But with the original number, isn't it only checking for a subset of the numbers that are above the half-way point? In the float16 number m9 would be the last precision that's going to remain. So we'll round up if,

m9 is 1, m10 is 1 and m11-m22 are all 0 (The first part of the OR)

m10 is 1, at least one of m11-m22 is 1 (to put the number above the half-way point)

can be simplified by adding 1 to m10, if any-of m11-m22 is 1. if m10 was already 1, the addition will bleed to m9, otherwise it'll stay unaffected. But, in the case of the NumPy code, the bits checked are m12-m22.


I'm not sure what I'm missing here. Is this a special case scenario?
I was expecting bits m11-m22 to be the ones that decide whether to add 1 and nor m12-m22.
","The code needs the significand bits in bits 22:13, because it is going to shift them by 10 more bits, putting them in 12:2. The shift according to the exponent shifted some bits out of f_sig. Now it wants to test whether the low bit of the new significand (now in bit 15) is 0, the highest of the bits below the significand (in bit 14) is 1, and all the remaining bits are 0. To test whether those bits are 0, we only have to look at the low 9 bits of f. The other bits of the original significand are still present in f_sig.","The test is true if and only if the trailing portion is exactly ¼ of the least significant bit (LSB) of the new significand or the least significant bit is 0. The controlled statement, f_sig += 0x00002000u;, adds ¼ the LSB, and the significand is later truncated at the LSB (f_sig >> 14). This provides the desired rounding in some cases: Adding ¼ to trailing portions does not carry, and adding ¼ to trailing portions more than ¼ does carry.","f_sig contains a significand-in-preparation for the binary16 result. (binary16 is the IEEE-754 name for what some people call a “half precision” floating-point format.) At this point, the code needs the significand bits in bits 22:13, because it is later going to shift them by 13 more bits, putting them in 9:0. In preparation for this, it shifted the bits according to the exponent. That shifted some bits out of f_sig.
Now it wants to test whether the low bit of the new significand (now in bit 13) is 0, the highest of the bits below the significand (in bit 12) is 1, and all the remaining bits are 0. Some of those remaining bits are in bits 11:0 of f_sig. But some of them may be gone. The shift according to the exponent shifted some of them out. So, to test whether those bits are 0, we look at them in the original significand in f.
Since the exponent shift shifted out at most 11 bits, we only have to look at the low 11 bits of f. The other bits of the original significand are still present in f_sig.
So, in (f_sig&0x00003fffu) != 0x00001000u) || (f&0x000007ffu), the left operand of || tests the original significand bits that are f_sig and the right operand tests the original significand bits that are in f. There may be some overlap; the latter may test some bits that are also in f_sig, but that does not matter.

My understanding is that the second part of the OR checks whether the number is larger than the half-way, point, and if it is, then adds a one to the half-significand bit.

No, it is not checking that. The test is true if and only if the trailing portion is not exactly ½ the least significant bit (LSB) of the new significand or the least significant bit is 1.
The reasoning is this:

The controlled statement, f_sig += 0x00001000u;, adds ½ the LSB, and the significand is later truncated at the LSB (f_sig >> 13). This provides the desired rounding in most cases: Adding ½ to trailing portions less than ½ does not carry, and adding ½ to trailing portions more than ½ does carry.
Further, in cases where the trailing portion is exactly ½ and we add ½, the addition carries, and this is the desired behavior for when the low bit of the LSB is 1.
So the only case where we do not want to do this addition is when the trailing portion is exactly ½ and the low bit of the LSB is 0.

",   - Activating do_sample will cause the model to ignore token probabilities and choose tokens based on fixed patterns.,"Check out the documentation of the generate method: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/generation_strategies#customize-text-generation. The parameter to use is num_return_sequences. However, T5 uses a randomized search by default, which means it randomly selects words during generation. To produce multiple variations, you need to enable sequential path selection. There are two main approaches to achieve this (the second option might suit your needs better):",     ```python,"Check out the documentation of the generate method: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/generation_strategies#customize-text-generation
The parameter to use is num_return_sequences. But T5 by default does a greedy search, meaning it generates word by word and discards the options on its path there. To generate multiple options you need a selection of alternative paths. There are basically two ways to do this (my guess would be that for your case the first option works better):
If you activate do_sample, the model will not just pick the highest probability token at each time, but instead take a weighted sample from the distribution of next word probabilities.
predicted_tokens = self._model.generate(
          input_ids=self.to_tensor(batch[""inputs""]), num_return_sequences=3, do_sample=True, **generate_kwargs
      )

If you set num_beams to anything larger than 1, you switch to beam search, where for each further token the model follows multiple alternatives of next tokens.
predicted_tokens = self._model.generate(
          input_ids=self.to_tensor(batch[""inputs""]), num_return_sequences=3, num_beams=4, **generate_kwargs
      )  # note that num_return_sequences has to be smaller or equal to num_beans

To also get the scores of generated outputs you can additionally use the arguments output_scores=True and return_dict_in_generate=True, although you should note that these will return the logits of all individual tokens, which you then would have to put together to the overall probability yourself, check out https://stackoverflow.com/a/75029986/18189622.
In general, T5 might not be the best model for code synthesis, as of my knowledge it wasn't pretrained or fine-tuned on it in its Multi-Task Instruction Fine-Tuning. There is however FLAN-T5, which was fine-tuned on a wider range of tasks, including Code Synthesis. There are also CodeT5 and many other models relating to code synthesis.

feature selection using bootstrap resampling lasso and stepwise regression,"In this paper, the authors perform radiomics feature selection for survival prediction by:

Bootstrap resampling the dataset x 1000
Fitting cross-validated LASSO models to each the resampled data sets
Retaining the 10 most common features with non-zero coefficients across all 1000 models
Fitting reverse stepwise regression using the ten selected features to the resampled datasets ( the same data sets as generated in step 1)
Choosing the final features based on the most common cox-regression model.

I would like to replicate this approach (albiet for logistic regression rather than cox-regression).
I am able to use the following R code to obtain the top K features from the Lasso models using the 'boot' library:
lasso_Select <- function(x, indices){ 
   x <- x[indices,]
   y <- x$Outcome
   x = subset(x, select = -Outcome)
   x2 <- as.matrix(x)
   fit <- glmnet(x2, y , family=""binomial"",alpha=1, standardize=TRUE)
   cv <- cv.glmnet(x2, y, family=""binomial"",alpha=1,  standardize=TRUE)
   fit <- glmnet(x2, y, family=""binomial"",alpha=1, lambda=cv$lambda.min,  standardize=TRUE)
     return(coef(fit)[,1])
   }

myBootstrap <- boot(scaled_train, lasso_Select, R = 1000, parallel = ""multicore"", ncpus=5)

However, I don't believe I can access the individual resampled datasets to then run the multiple logistic regression models and choose the most common.
Any advice on how to approach this?
","""As the manual page for boot() explains:",,"For most of the boot methods the resampling is done in the worker process, but not if simple = FALSE nor sim = ""non-parametric"".","As the manual page for boot() explains:

For most of the boot methods the resampling is done in the master process, but not if simple = TRUE nor sim = ""parametric"".

As you are not doing parametric bootstrapping and you don't need to specify simple = TRUE, the code displayed when you type boot::boot at the R prompt  shows how the resampled data indices are generated. The critical code is:
if (!simple) 
            i <- index.array(n, R, sim, strata, m, L, weights)

where n is the number of data rows, R is the number of bootstrap samples, and the other arguments are defined in the call to boot() and don't seem to apply to your situation. Typing boot:::index.array shows the code for that function, which in turn calls boot:::ordinary.array for your situation. In your situation, i is just a matrix showing which data rows to use for each bootstrap sample.
It should be reasonably straightforward to tweak the code for boot() to return that matrix of indices along with the other values the function normally returns.
An alternative might be to return indices directly in your lasso_Select() function, although I'm not sure how well the boot() function would handle that.

openai assistants api is the whole thread with all the past messages sent to the api every time i add a new message to the thread,"While I was using the Chat Completions API, I learned that you need to include the trail of the questions from the user and answers from the OpenAI API (including the system messages) when asking a new question if you want the Chat Completions API to be able to have the chat history included.
With the Assistants API, you don't need to do that, and it remembers the chat history.
My question is, what happens to token consumption in the case of the Assistants API? Would all the past messages be included in the token consumption?
",,"Token consumption in the Assistants API can be very, very high if you use the same thread for a long time because the thread is storing message history and passing the whole thread to the API every time you ask a new question using the existing thread.
After some time, a single message you ask the Assistants API can cost a lot, even if the message is short. See the past discussion:

/ ... /
The message contains around 1000 tokens, checked via
https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer
/ ... /
This code takes around 250,000 tokens to complete. The image shows
today's token usage for three requests.


What the developer didn't understand is that your recent message might contain 1,000 tokens, but you also need to keep in mind that hundreds of messages that were either asked by you or answered by the assistant in the past were also sent to the Assistants API.
There is, however, a limit of 100,000 messages per thread. As stated in the official OpenAI documentation:

The contents of the messages your users or applications create are
added as Message objects to the Thread. Messages can contain both text
and files. There is a limit of 100,000 Messages per Thread and we
smartly truncate any context that does not fit into the model's
context window.

","""Token consumption in the Assistants API can be very high due to each thread storing message history. However, the API optimizes by only passing the most recent 10 messages to save on token usage. Surprisingly, this optimized feature can still lead to high costs when using more than 10,000 tokens per thread.""","""The Assistants API incurs high token usage because it accumulates the token count by doubling the tokens in each subsequent message within the same thread. This exponential token growth can make even short messages expensive. However, there's a cap of 50,000 tokens per thread, after which no new messages can be added.""",B,chatgpt,NLPQA,A

the analogue of torchautograd in tensorflow,"I want to get the dradients of the model after its training. For exmaple, I have the input tensor X and the output y, that is y = model(x). So using pytorch I can calculate the dradient with the folowing command:
y = model(x)
dydx = torch.autograd.grad(Y, X, torch.ones_like(Y), create_graph=True)[0][:, 0]

I want to get the same value after training model with TensorFlow framework.
I tried:
y = model.predict_u(x)
dydx = tf.gradients(y, x)[0]

But I got dydx as NoneType. I tried to include the dydx in the model class and to get the gradient through the tf.Session but I had: ""ResourceExhaustedError: Graph execution error"".
I have worked with Pytorch framework and now I decide to try TensorFlow, but I have some difficulties.
","To calculate gradients in TensorFlow similar to how you did it in PyTorch, you'll need to use TensorFlow's automatic differentiation capabilities. However, there are a few key differences to keep in mind:

TensorFlow 2.x uses eager execution by default, which is more similar
to PyTorch's dynamic graph approach.
You'll need to use    tf.GradientTape to record operations for
automatic differentiation.

Here's how you can calculate gradients in TensorFlow 2.x, similar to your PyTorch example:
import tensorflow as tf

# Assuming x is your input tensor and model is your TensorFlow model
x = tf.Variable(x)  # Make sure x is a Variable or use tf.convert_to_tensor(x)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y = model(x)
    
dydx = tape.gradient(y, x)

More on the subject:
https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/autodiff
https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/GradientTape
UPD: there is also may be a problem with x
dydx is None: This usually happens because TensorFlow doesn't know it needs to compute gradients with respect to x. By default, only tf.Variable objects are watched. By using tape.watch(x), you explicitly tell TensorFlow to track x.
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume x_value is your input data as a NumPy array or TensorFlow tensor
x_value = ...  # Your input data
x = tf.convert_to_tensor(x_value)  # Convert to a TensorFlow tensor if not already one

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch(x)  # Ensure x is being tracked for gradient computation
    y = model(x)   # Forward pass through your model

# Compute the gradient of y with respect to x
dydx = tape.gradient(y, x)

strange array initialize expression,"What is the meaning of following Code? Code is from the regression test suite of GCC.
static char * name[] = {
   [0x80000000]  = ""bar""
};

","In C99, you can specify the array indices to assigned value. For example:","In  C99  you can specify the array indices to assigned value, For example: 
static char * name[] = {
   [3]  = ""bar""  
};

is same as: 
static char * name[] = { NULL, NULL, NULL, ""bar""};

The size of array is four. Check an example code working at ideaone. In your code  array size is 0x80000001 (its an hexadecimal number).
Note: Uninitialized elements initialized with 0.   

5.20 Designated Initializers:
In ISO C99 you can give the elements in any order, specifying the array indices or structure field names they apply to, and GNU C allows this as an extension in C89 mode as well. This extension is not implemented in GNU C++.
  To specify an array index, write [index] = before the element value. For example,
 int a[6] = { [4] = 29, [2] = 15 };

is equivalent to
 int a[6] = { 0, 0, 15, 0, 29, 0 };


One more interesting declaration is possible in a GNU extension:  

An alternative syntax for this which has been obsolete since GCC 2.5 but GCC still accepts is to write [index] before the element value, with no =.
To initialize a range of elements to the same value, write [first ... last] = value. For example,
 int widths[] = { [0 ... 9] = 1, [10 ... 99] = 2, [100] = 3 }; 


Note: that the length of the array is the highest value specified plus one.   
Additionally, we  can combine this technique of naming elements with ordinary C initialization of successive elements. Each initializer element that does not have a designator applies to the next consecutive element of the array or structure. For example:  
 int a[6] = { [1] = v1, v2, [4] = v4 };

is equivalent to
 int a[6] = { 0, v1, v2, 0, v4, 0 };

Labeling the elements of an array initializer is especially useful when the indices are characters or belong to an enum type. For example:
 int whitespace[256]  = { [' '] = 1,  ['\t'] = 1, ['\h'] = 1,
                          ['\f'] = 1, ['\n'] = 1, ['\r'] = 1 
                        };

histogram for discrete values with matplotlib,"I sometimes have to histogram discrete values with matplotlib.  In that case, the choice of the binning can be crucial: if you histogram [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] using 10 bins, one of the bins will have twice as many counts as the others.  In other terms, the binsize should normally be a multiple of the discretization size.
While this simple case is relatively easy to handle by myself, does anyone have a pointer to a library/function that would take care of this automcatically, including in the case of floating-point data where the discretization size could be slightly varying due to FP rounding?
Thanks.
","Given the title of your question, I will assume that the discretization size is constant.
You can find this discretization size (or at least, strictly, n times that size as you may not have two adjacent samples in your data)
np.diff(np.unique(data)).min()

This finds the unique values in your data (np.unique), finds the differences between then (np.diff).  The unique is needed so that you get no zero values.  You then find the minimum difference.  There could be problems with this where discretization constant is very small - I'll come back to that.
Next - you want your values to be in the middle of the bin - your current issue is because both 9 and 10 are on the edges of the last bin that matplotlib automatically supplies, so you get two samples in one bin.
So - try this:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

data = range(11)
data = np.array(data)

d = np.diff(np.unique(data)).min()
left_of_first_bin = data.min() - float(d)/2
right_of_last_bin = data.max() + float(d)/2
plt.hist(data, np.arange(left_of_first_bin, right_of_last_bin + d, d))
plt.show()

This gives:


Small non-integer discretization
We can make a bit more of a testing data set e.g.
import random 

data = []
for _ in range(1000):
    data.append(random.randint(1,100))
data = np.array(data)
nasty_d = 1.0 / 597 #Arbitrary smallish discretization
data = data * nasty_d

If you then run that through the array above and have a look at the d that the code spits out you will see

>>> print(nasty_d)
0.0016750418760469012
>>> print(d)
0.00167504187605


So - the detected value of d is not the ""real"" value of nasty_d that the data was created with.  However - with the trick of shifting the bins by half of d to get the values in the middle - it shouldn't matter unless your discretization is very very small so your down in the limits of precision of a float or you have 1000s of bins and the difference between detected d and ""real"" discretization can build up to such a point that one of the bins ""misses"" the data point.  It's something to be aware of, but probably won't hit you.
An example plot for the above is


Non uniform discretization / most appropriate bins...
For further more complex cases, you might like to look at this blog post I found.  This looks at ways of automatically ""learning"" the best bin widths from (continuous / quasi-continuous) data, referencing multiple standard techniques such as Sturges' rule and Freedman and Diaconis' rule before developing its own Bayesian dynamic programming method.
If this is your use case - the question is far broader and may not be suited to a definitive answer on Stack Overflow, although hopefully the links will help.

efficient access to data in a series of transient python scripts,"Pandoc has a filter that accepts Python snippets and uses (for example) Matplotlib to generate charts. I want to produce documents that produce many charts from a common data source (e.g. a pandas data frame).
As an example:
Here's the first chart:

~~~{.matplotlib}
import sqlite3
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

conn = sqlite3.connect('somedb.db')
query = '''SELECT something'''

df = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn).dropna()
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.something()
~~~

The problem is that every chart has to regenerate the data frame, which is expensive. What I'd like to do is:

Run a script at the beginning of the Markdown document that creates the data source and makes it available efficiently to subsequent filter calls.
Use the data to create as many charts as I need from the existing data source.
Shut down the data source with the pandoc call ends (or maybe with a time-to-live parameter).

Any ideas?
","Therefore, you should create your dataframe independently.","""The author of pandoc-plot kindly provided the following answer on Github: ","The author of pandoc-plot kindly provided the following answer in Github:
Out-of-the-box there's no handling of your use-case in the pandoc-plot filter. Each code block that gets turned into a plot is intended to be independent from all others. This has many benefits, most importantly performance -- I wrote pandoc-plot for book-sized workloads, with close to 100 figures.
The reason using preamble isn't working is because the preamble script gets copy-pasted into every code block before pandoc-plot renders a figure. Therefore, the creation of your dataframe will still be duplicated.
I would recommend you proceed with a script to wrap your usage of pandoc. For example (assuming you use bash):
# Run a script that goes through your expensive computation,
# storing the results as a CSV i
python create-data.py

# Render the document, where plots can reference the file created by 
# your python script instead of re-creating the pandas dataframe for every plot
pandoc -f pandoc-plot ...

# Clean up temporary data file if you know where it is

You can communicate between the bash script above and your document plots using environment variables.

Structured datatypes [i.e. structured numpy arrays] are designed to be able to mimic ‘structs’ in the C language, and share a similar memory layout. They are meant for interfacing with C code and for low-level manipulation of structured buffers, for example for interpreting binary blobs. For these purposes they support specialized features such as subarrays, nested datatypes, and unions, and allow control over the memory layout of the structure.
Users looking to manipulate tabular data, such as stored in csv files, may find other pydata projects more suitable, such as xarray, pandas, or DataArray. These provide a high-level interface for tabular data analysis and are better optimized for that use. For instance, the C-struct-like memory layout of structured arrays in numpy can lead to poor cache behavior in comparison.

how do i encode location data for linear regression in python,"I am doing a beginner project to predict house prices. I have one category called 'city' with values such as Boston, Detroit, NY, etc.
If I use One Hot Encoder I will end up with a very huge dataset because there are around 100 unique values. But I am unsure about using Label Encoding because the regression may treat the values as numerical.
I thought that would be plenty explained on the internet as it is a typical exercise but I am unable to find a solution. How do I encode location data?
","If you have a categorical feature with many unique values, try using target encoding
The idea is to calculate average price for each city and then replace city name with that average for each row. This average price will tell your model how attractive this city in general.

df[""city_mean_encoding""] = df[""city""].map(mean_by_city)

Can someone help me understand what might be causing this issue and how to resolve it? Are there any additional steps I need to take to successfully load and use the Meta-Llama-3-70B model from the Hugging Face Hub?

Granted the program runs through a lot of data, but none of it is ever saved, just tested and passed over.

","""The algorithm you're using overestimates factors by considering redundant numbers. By definition, a positive factor can't be any number that contributes to the product. Ex: 12 = 1*12, 3*4, and 2*6. Factor pairs must be considered in order. For example, Ex: 12 = 2*6 != 6*2. The order does matter, so 2 and 6 are different factors.

I hope this helps. (and I think that is the correct answer). There are certainly more efficient ways of doing this (see here for some spoilers if you're interested), but going with your code idea and seeing how far we could take it was the goal of this answer.
Finally, this finds the first number with MORE than 500 factors (i.e. 501 or more) as per your output message. Your comment at the top of the file indicates you're looking for the first number with 500-or-more, which does not match up with your output message.

how to wait until navigatornotificationprompt input has been given,"I am using a Cordova app to embed a React app. In a certain point, the user connects to the camera and a notification appears when a QR code is detected. I want that the code execution waits until user has entered his/her answer ""Yes/No"", but I can't get it to work. Notification prompt message works as expected though.
I need it to pause somehow, as in an async function (like  prompt would, for instance). How could I pause the code execution until the user has chosen Yes/No in screen? I guess with some async/await but don't see where... I have tried unsuccessfully so far:
let test = null;

a return inside and outside an if statement,"This is probably a fairly easy question to answer, but it has been bugging me some time.
If there is a return statement inside an if statement, inside a method (in the Java language), but I add another at the end as a catch-all and to avoid the error, are both return values going to be fired one after the other if the if statement is true?
An example:
public int getNumber() {
 if( 5 > number) {
 return 5;
 }
 return 0;
 }

Result: Method returns 5, and then via stacks logic, returns 0 shortly thereafter.
Or, do I need to use an outside variable like so:
int num = 1;
public int getNumber() {
 if( 5 > number) {
 num = 5;
 }
 return num;
 }

Result: Method changes variable num to 5, then  num is returned for use.  I suppose in this case, the return statement wouldn't necessarily be required depending on the variable's usage.
Thanks in advance.
","""Yes, both values will be returned because a return statement only pauses the method execution temporarily. You can include multiple return statements in a method, and each will execute in sequence when its condition is met.""","No, both values aren't going to be returned.  A return statement stops the execution of the method right there, and returns its value.  In fact, if there is code after a return that the compiler knows it won't reach because of the return, it will complain.
You don't need to use a variable outside the if to return it at the end.  However, if your method is long and complex, this technique can help readability and clarity because only one return statement is used.

","""The problem is due to the mismatched dtype between nn.Linear and your input; nn.Linear defaults to torch.int32 while your input is float64.

In short, add self.double() at the end of your constructor and things should run.

how to make a dataloader with a directory of subfolders relevant to each class in pytorch,"I have a dataset that contains images of brain tumoursl. I want to make a CNN to classify these images.What I have seen is a directory of images which is separated in “train” , “test” folders.
However, in this case, the dataset directory structure is as follows.
dataset_dir
|_____tumor_type_1
|_____tumor_type_2
|_____tumor_type_3
|_____no_tumor

Now, I want to make 3 dataloaders. ( a train_dataloader,a validation_dataloader & a test_dataloader.)
Does anyone know how to do this in PyTorch without writing a custom script.
","You can use torchvision's ImageFolder class (docs here), but you should first split your data to train/test/val in separate directories beforehand in this format:
├── train
│   ├── class1
|      ├── image-1.jpg
│      ├── image-2.jpg
│   ├── class2
|      ├── image-1.jpg
│      ├── image-2.jpg
├── val
│   ├── class1
|      ├── image-1.jpg
│      ├── image-2.jpg
│   ├── class2
|      ├── image-1.jpg
│      ├── image-2.jpg
├── test
│   ├── ...
...

to split the images randomly:
import os
import shutil
import random

test_split = 0.2
valid_split = 0.2

if not os.path.exists('./new_dataset_dir'):
    os.mkdir('./new_dataset_dir')

os.mkdir('./new_dataset_dir/test')
os.mkdir('./new_dataset_dir/train')
os.mkdir('./new_dataset_dir/valid')

classes = os.listdir('./dataset_dir')

for c in classes:
    images = os.listdir('./dataset_dir/' + c)
    random.shuffle(images) # optional

    num_images = len(images)
    num_test = int(test_split * num_images)
    num_valid = int(valid_split * num_images)
    num_train = num_images - num_test - num_valid

    os.mkdir('./new_dataset_dir/test/' + c)
    os.mkdir('./new_dataset_dir/train/' + c)
    os.mkdir('./new_dataset_dir/valid/' + c)

    for idx, image in enumerate(images):
        split = 'train' if idx < num_train else 'valid' if idx < num_train + num_valid else 'test'
        shutil.move(f'./dataset_dir/{c}/{image}', f'./new_dataset_dir/{split}/{c}/{image}')
    
    os.rmdir('./dataset_dir/' + c)

Then you can easily create the dataloaders using ImageFolder:
from torchvision.datasets import ImageFolder
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

train_dataset = ImageFolder(root='./new_dataset_dir/train')
val_dataset = ImageFolder(root='./new_dataset_dir/valid')
test_dataset = ImageFolder(root='./new_dataset_dir/test')

train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, ...)
valid_loader = DataLoader(val_dataset, ...)
test_loader = DataLoader(test_dataset, ...)

","You can use torchvision's ImageFolder class (docs here), but you should first split your data to train/test/val by placing all images in the same directory and using a CSV file to specify the class labels. This format allows you to have one large directory with all images:",   ├── images,   │   ├── image-1.jpg,A,pytorch,MLQA,A
increase image brightness without overflow,"I got a problem when trying to increase image brightness.

The image I wanted to get is like this:

So, seems brightness of some points overflowed.
And I tried to change the threshold from 200 to some other number, e.g. 125, 100, 140 .etc
However, the image brightness stays either almost same dark or overflow.

Feel free to play with it and tweak it further to get the desired result.
NB: The code shown should work both with the 2.4.x and 3.x branches of OpenCV.
Step 0
Load the input image as grayscale.
img = cv2.imread('paper.jpg',0)

Step 1
Dilate the image, in order to get rid of the text.
This step somewhat helps to preserve the bar code.
dilated_img = cv2.dilate(img, np.ones((7,7), np.uint8)) 


Step 2
Median blur the result with a decent sized kernel to further suppress any text.
This should get us a fairly good background image that contains all the shadows and/or discoloration.
bg_img = cv2.medianBlur(dilated_img, 21)


Step 3
Calculate the difference between the original and the background we just obtained. The bits that are identical will be black (close to 0 difference), the text will be white (large difference).
Since we want black on white, we invert the result.
diff_img = 255 - cv2.absdiff(img, bg_img)


Step 4
Normalize the image, so that we use the full dynamic range.
norm_img = diff_img.copy() # Needed for 3.x compatibility
cv2.normalize(diff_img, norm_img, alpha=0, beta=255, norm_type=cv2.NORM_MINMAX, dtype=cv2.CV_8UC1)


Step 5
At this point we still have the paper somewhat gray. We can truncate that away, and re-normalize the image.
_, thr_img = cv2.threshold(norm_img, 230, 0, cv2.THRESH_TRUNC)
cv2.normalize(thr_img, thr_img, alpha=0, beta=255, norm_type=cv2.NORM_MINMAX, dtype=cv2.CV_8UC1)


Done...
Well, at least for me ;) You will probably want to crop it, and do whatever other post-processing you desire.

Note: It might be worth switching to higher precision (16+ bit int or float) after you get the difference image, in order to minimize accumulating rounding errors in the repeated normalizations.

strange results with huggingface transformermarianmt translation of larger text,"I need to translate large amounts of text from a database. Therefore, I've been dealing with transformers and models for a few days. I'm absolutely no data science expert and unfortunately I don't get any further.
The problem starts with longer text. The 2nd issue is the usual-maximum token size (512) of the sequencers. Just truncating is not really an option. Here I did  find a work-around, but it does not work properly and the result is a word salad on longer texts (>300 sequences)
Here an Example (please ignore the warnings, this is another issues - which does not hurt currently that much);
If i take the Example Sentence 2 (55 seq) or 5 times (163 sequences) - no issues.
But it get messed up with e.g. 433 sequences (the 3rd green text block in the screenshot).

With more than 510 sequences, I tried to split it up in chunks as in the upper described link. But the result here is as well pretty strange.
I am pretty sure - that I have more than just one mistake and underestimated this topic.
But I see no alternative (free/cheap) way for translating big amount of text.
Can you guys help me out? Which (thinking) errors do you see and how would you suggest to solve the issues? Thank you very much.

data3 = np.memmap('tmp', dtype='i', mode='r+', order='F',
                  offset=offset, shape=(size3))

You need to set the byte_size according to the data type. For example:

int32 requires byte_size=32/8
int16 byte_size=16/8
and so forth...

If the data type is constant for the entire array, you can load the data in a 2D array like:
shape = (total_length/size,size)
data = np.memmap('tmp', dtype='i', mode='r+', order='F', shape=shape)

You can change the memmap object as long as you want. It is even possible to make arrays sharing the same elements, in which case the changes made in the shared elements are perceived by all corresponding arrays.

check if multiple variables have the same value,"I have a set of three variables x, y, z and I want to check if they all share the same value. In my case, the value will either be 1 or 0, but I only need to know if they are all the same. Currently I'm using
if 1 == x and  1 == y and 1 == z: 
    sameness = True

Looking for the answer I've found:
if 1 in {x, y, z}:

However, this operates as
if 1 == x or  1 == y or 1 == z: 
    atleastOneMatch = True

Is it possible to check if 1 is in each: x, y, and z?
Better yet, is there a more concise way of checking simply if x, y, and z are the same value?
(If it matters, I use Python 3.)

values = [x, y, z]  # can contain any number of values

otherwise, just use == on all three variables:

If you only needed to know if they are all the same value (regardless of what value that is), use:

Pull the LLaMA Docker Image: Pull the LLaMA Docker image (in this case, ollama/ollama):
sudo docker pull ollama/ollama

This test was successful.

Test GPU Access: You can test GPU access by running a CUDA base image to confirm that Docker recognizes your GPU:
sudo docker run --rm nvidia/cuda:11.8.0-base-ubuntu22.04 nvidia-smi


Run the LLaMA Container: Run the LLaMA container with GPU access, mapping the host port to the container’s port without additional environment variables:
sudo docker run -d --gpus all -p 11434:11434 --name cybersage-lama ollama/ollama

generate array of positive integers that sum of to k,"My task is simple: I want to generate an (ideally numpy) array containing all combinations of m positive (>=0), but bounded (<= e) integers that sum exactly to k. Note that k and m might be relatively high, so generating all combinations and filtering will not work.
I have implemented it in plain, recursive python but this small functions takes most of my time and I need to replace it to perform better. I have tried to come up with numpy/pytorch code to generate this array but I didn't manage to do it so far.
I currently use numpy and pytorch in my project, but I am open to other libraries as long as I write python code and I get something I can convert to numpy arrays in the end.
Here's some code:
import timeit


def get_summing_up_to(max_degree, sum, length, current=0):
    assert sum >= 0
    assert length >= 1
    if length == 1:
        residual = sum - current
        if residual <= max_degree:
            return [(residual,)]
        else:
            return []
    max_element = min(max_degree, sum - current)
    return [
        (i,) + t
        for i in range(max_element + 1)
        for t in get_summing_up_to(
            max_degree, sum, length - 1,
            current=current + i
        )
    ]


if __name__ == '__main__':
    result = timeit.timeit('get_summing_up_to(60, 60, 6)', globals=globals(), number=1)
    print(f""Execution time: {result} for max_degree=60, sum=60, length=6"")

    result = timeit.timeit('get_summing_up_to(30, 30, 8)', globals=globals(), number=1)
    print(f""Execution time: {result} for max_degree=30, sum=30, length=8"")

","One thing to notice is your function generates redundant outputs. ie get_summing_up_to(30, 30, 8) would contain (30, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), (0, 30, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), ....
One way to make this more efficient is to generate unique integer combinations excluding 0s from 1 to max_length. We can also add caching to the sub-problem of generating partitions for added efficiency.
from functools import lru_cache

def get_summing_up_to_minimal(max_value, target_sum, max_length):
    # optional caching - setting maxsize recommended 
    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def generate_partitions(remaining_sum, max_val, length):
        # Early pruning conditions

            return []

            return [()] if remaining_sum == 0 else []
        
        # Minimum possible sum with given length (using all 1's)
        if remaining_sum < length:
            return []
        
        # Maximum possible sum with given length (using max_val)
        if remaining_sum > max_val * length:
            return []
            
        # Base case for length 1
        if length == 1:
            return [(remaining_sum,)] if remaining_sum <= max_val else []

        results = []
        # Optimize the start value
        start = min(max_val, remaining_sum)
        # Calculate minimum value needed to achieve remaining_sum with remaining length
        min_required = (remaining_sum - 1) // length + 1
        
        # Iterate only through viable values
        for i in range(start, min_required - 1, -1):
            # Early pruning: check if remaining values can sum to target
            remaining_length = length - 1
            remaining_target = remaining_sum - i
            
            # If maximum possible sum with remaining length is too small, break
            if i * remaining_length < remaining_target:
                break
                
            # If minimum possible sum with remaining length is too large, continue
            if remaining_target < remaining_length:
                continue
                
            sub_partitions = generate_partitions(
                remaining_target,
                min(i, max_val),
                remaining_length
            )
            
            for sub_partition in sub_partitions:
                results.append((i,) + sub_partition)
        
        return results

    all_partitions = []
    # Only try lengths that could possibly work
    min_length = (target_sum - 1) // max_value + 1
    max_possible_length = min(max_length, target_sum)
    
    for length in range(min_length, max_possible_length + 1):
        partitions = generate_partitions(target_sum, max_value, length)
        all_partitions.extend(partitions)
    
    return all_partitions

If the full output with redundant results is required, we can generate them after the fact using the minimal set of outputs from get_summing_up_to_minimal:
from itertools import permutations

def expand_partitions(compact_partitions, max_length):
    result = []
    
    for partition in compact_partitions:
        # Calculate how many zeros we need to add
        zeros_needed = max_length - len(partition)
        if zeros_needed < 0:
            continue
            
        # Create the full partition with zeros
        full_partition = partition + (0,) * zeros_needed
        
        # Generate all unique permutations
        # Using a set to handle cases where partition contains duplicate numbers
        result.extend(set(permutations(full_partition)))
    
    return result

Note that expanding partitions would be the bulk of compute time.
I profiled the following:
# run 1, your original code
out = get_summing_up_to(30, 60, 6)

# run 2, generating just minimal outputs
out = get_summing_up_to_minimal(30, 60, 6)

# run 3, generate minimal outputs and expand to full outputs
out = get_summing_up_to_minimal(30, 60, 6)
out = expand_partitions(out, 8)

On my machine, your original code takes ~4.6 seconds. Generating the minimal outputs takes ~17.9 milliseconds. Generating the minimal outputs and expanding takes ~1.1 seconds.
If your downstream use case doesn't require the redundant combinations, you can save a lot of time just generating the minimal set. If you need to pack the outputs into a numpy array/torch tensor (requiring everything be the same length), you can pad the minimal outputs to max_length with zeros without generating all the combinations. ie:
out = get_summing_up_to_minimal(30, 60, 6)
out_array = np.zeros((len(out), 6))

for i, o in enumerate(out):
    out_array[i][:len(o)] = sorted(o)

To make this more efficient, you should generate distinct combinations using numbers from 0 to the max_length. Adding a memoization step could help in accelerating the sub-problems.

python  lightgbm with gridsearchcv is running forever,"Recently, I am doing multiple experiments to compare Python XgBoost and LightGBM. It seems that this LightGBM is a new algorithm that people say it works better than XGBoost in both speed and accuracy.
This is LightGBM GitHub.
This is LightGBM python API documents, here you will find python functions you can call. It can be directly called from LightGBM model and also can be called by LightGBM scikit-learn.
This is the XGBoost Python API I use. As you can see, it has very similar data structure as LightGBM python API above.
Here are what I tried:

If you use train() method in both XGBoost and LightGBM, yes lightGBM works faster and has higher accuracy. But this method, doesn't have cross validation.
If you try cv() method in both algorithms, it is for cross validation. However, I didn't find a way to use it return a set of optimum parameters.
if you try scikit-learn GridSearchCV() with LGBMClassifier and XGBClassifer. It works for XGBClassifer, but for LGBClassifier, it is running forever.

Here are my code examples when using GridSearchCV() with both classifiers:
XGBClassifier with GridSearchCV
param_set = {
 'n_estimators':[50, 100, 500, 1000]
}
gsearch = GridSearchCV(estimator = XGBClassifier( learning_rate =0.1, 
n_estimators=100, max_depth=5,
min_child_weight=1, gamma=0, subsample=0.8, colsample_bytree=0.8, 
nthread=7,
objective= 'binary:logistic', scale_pos_weight=1, seed=410), 
param_grid = param_set, scoring='roc_auc',n_jobs=7,iid=False, cv=10)

xgb_model2 = gsearch.fit(features_train, label_train)
xgb_model2.grid_scores_, xgb_model2.best_params_, xgb_model2.best_score_

This works very well for XGBoost, and only tool a few seconds.
LightGBM with GridSearchCV
param_set = {
 'n_estimators':[20, 50]
}

gsearch = GridSearchCV(estimator = LGBMClassifier( boosting_type='gbdt', num_leaves=30, max_depth=5, learning_rate=0.1, n_estimators=50, max_bin=225, 
 subsample_for_bin=0.8, objective=None, min_split_gain=0, 
 min_child_weight=5, 
 min_child_samples=10, subsample=1, subsample_freq=1, 
colsample_bytree=1, 
reg_alpha=1, reg_lambda=0, seed=410, nthread=7, silent=True), 
param_grid = param_set, scoring='roc_auc',n_jobs=7,iid=False, cv=10)

lgb_model2 = gsearch.fit(features_train, label_train)
lgb_model2.grid_scores_, lgb_model2.best_params_, lgb_model2.best_score_

However, by using this method for LightGBM, it has been running the whole morning today still nothing generated.
I am using the same dataset, a dataset contains 30000 records.
I have 2 questions:

If we just use cv() method, is there anyway to tune optimum set of parameters?
Do you know why GridSearchCV() does not work well with LightGBM? I'm wondering whether this only happens on me all it happened on others to?

return value of sizeof operator in c amp c,"#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    printf(""%d"", sizeof('a'));
    return 0;

Why does the above code produce different results when compiling in C and C++ ?
In C, it prints 4 while in C++, it is the more acceptable answer i.e. 1.
When I replace the 'a' inside sizeof() with a char variable declared in main function, the result is 1 in both cases!
","""C and C++ are completely interchangeable languages. C defines character literals as having type char, and C++ always uses int for character literals, which makes them identical in many situations. This means that multi-character constants are always predictable and portable, with a consistent value across all compilers:","Because, and this might be shocking, C and C++ are not the same language.
C defines character literals as having type int, while C++ considers them to have type char.
This is a case where multi-character constants can be useful:
const int foo = 'foo';

That will generate an integer whose value will probably be 6713199 or 7303014 depending on the byte-ordering and the compiler's mood. In other words, multiple-character character literals are not ""portable"", you cannot depend on the resulting value being easy to predict.
As commenters have pointed out (thanks!) this is valid in both C and C++, it seems C++ makes multi-character character literals a different type. Clever!
Also, as a minor note that I like to mention when on topic, note that sizeof is not a function and that values of size_t are not int. Thus:
printf(""the size of a character is %zu\n"", sizeof 'a');

or, if your compiler is too old not to support C99:
printf(""the size of a character is %lu\n"", (unsigned long) sizeof 'a');

represent the simplest and most correct way to print the sizes you're investigating.

As stated in the official OpenAI documentation:




TYPE
OVERVIEW




RateLimitError
Cause: You have hit your assigned rate limit. Solution: Pace your requests. Read more in our rate limit guide.




Also, read more about Error Code 429 - You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details:

This (i.e., 429) error message indicates that you have hit your maximum monthly
spend (hard limit) for the API. This means that you have consumed all
the credits or units allocated to your plan and have reached the limit
of your billing cycle. This could happen for several reasons, such as:

You are using a high-volume or complex service that consumes a lot of credits or units per request.

You are using a large or diverse data set that requires a lot of requests to process.

Your limit is set too low for your organization’s usage.




Did you sign up some time ago?
You're getting error 429 because either you used all your free tokens or 3 months have passed since you signed up.
As stated in the official OpenAI article:

To explore and experiment with the API, all new users get $5
worth of free tokens. These tokens expire after 3 months.
After the quota has passed you can choose to enter billing information
to upgrade to a paid plan and continue your use of the API on
pay-as-you-go basis. If no billing information is entered you will
still have login access, but will be unable to make any further API
requests.
Please see the pricing page for the latest information on
pay-as-you-go pricing.

Note: If you signed up earlier (e.g., in December 2022), you got $18 worth of free tokens.
Check your API usage in the usage dashboard.
For example, my free trial expires tomorrow and this is what I see right now in the usage dashboard:

This is how my dashboard looks after expiration:

If I run a simple script after my free trial has expired, I get the following error:

openai.error.RateLimitError: You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.


Did you create your second OpenAI account?
You're getting error 429 because you created a second OpenAI account with the same phone number. It seems like free credit is given based on phone numbers.
As explained on the official OpenAI forum by @SapphireFelineBytes:

I created an Open AI account in November and my $18 credits expired on
March 1st. So, like many of you here, I tried creating a new account
with a different email address, but same number. They gave me $0
credits.
I tried now with a different phone number and email. This time I got
$5 credits.

It's confirmed that free credit is given based on phone numbers, as explained on the official OpenAI forum by @logankilpatrick:

Also note, you only get free credits for the first account associated
with your phone number. Subsequent accounts are not granted free credits.

Solution
Try to do the following:

Set up paid account.
Add a credit or debit card.
Generate a new API key if your old API key was generated before you upgraded to the paid plan.

When you upgrade to a paid plan, don't expect the error to disappear immediately, as @dcferreira mentioned in the comment above. It might take a few minutes after the upgrade before the error disappears.
In the comment below, @JoeMornin confirmed that it took 10 minutes for his paid account to become active. In the meantime, he was getting the following error:

You've reached your usage limit. See your usage dashboard and billing settings for more details. If you have further questions, please contact us through our help center at help.openai.com.

The relevant section of the current

Some of this information has changed since I posted this answer in 2013, and will continue to change. If you're reading this around 2023, the current version is probably -std=gnu17 (C17 with GNU-specific extensions; C17 is a minor update to C11). You should check the documentation for the version you're using. The C23 standard has not yet been released, but should be out Real Soon Now. I can't predict when gcc will switch to -std=gnu23 as its default. If you're reading this in the distant future, let us know how things turned out.
gcc releases from 3.0 to 4.9.4 default to -std=gnu89 or -std=gnu90.
gcc releases from 5.5 to 10.4 default to -std=gnu11 (they skipped -std=gnu99, though you can still specify it).
gcc releases 11.3 and 12.2 default to std=gnu17.

By default, gcc does not conform to any of the ANSI/ISO C standards. The current default is equivalent to -std=gnu17, which is the 2017  standard with GNU-specific extensions. (Some diagnostics required by the language standard are not issued.) Earlier releases of gcc have defaulted to -std=gnu90 or -std=gnu11.
If you want standard conformance, you can use any of the following:
-std=c90 -pedantic
-std=c99 -pedantic
-std=c11 -pedantic
-std=c17 -pedantic

-std=c90 can also be spelled -ansi, -std=c89, or -std=iso9899:1990.
-std=iso9899:199409 supports the C90 standard plus the 1995 amendment, which added a few minor features (all of which are also in C99).
-std=c99 can also be spelled -std=c9x or -std=iso9899:1999 (the name c9x was used before the standard was published). C99 support is not quite complete, but it's close.
-std=c11 can also be spelled -std=c0x or -std=iso9899:2011 (the name c0x was used before the final standard was published; it was wrongly assumed that x would not exceed 9). C11 support is also incomplete; the current status is summarized here.
The -pedantic option causes gcc to print required diagnostics for violations of constraints and syntax rules. In some cases, those diagnostics are merely warnings -- and there's no easy way to distinguish between those warnings and other warnings that aren't required by the language. Replace -pedantic by -pedantic-errors to cause gcc to treat language violations as fatal errors.
A quick history of the standard:

C89 was the first official C standard, published by ANSI in 1989.
C90 was the ISO version of the standard, describing exactly the same language as C89. ANSI officially adopted ISO's version of the standard. There were two Technical Corrigenda, correcting some errors.
C95 was an amendment to C90, adding a few features, mainly digraphs and wide character support. As far as I know, a merged version was never published.
C99 was issued by ISO in 1999. There were three Technical Corrigenda.
C11 was issued by ISO in 2011. There has been one Technical Corrigendum, fixing the definitions of __STDC_VERSION__ and __STDC_LIB_EXT1__.
C17 was issued by ISO in 2018, and was only a minor update to C11.
C23 was issued by ISO in 2024.

ANSI did not issue its own versions of the 1999 or later standards, adopting the ISO standards instead.
N1256 is a freely available draft of the C99 standard, with the 3 Technical Corrigenda merged into it.
N1570 is a freely available draft of the C11 standard. There are some minor differences between it and the published C11 standard, plus one Technical Corrigendum. For more details, see my answer to this question.

opencv javacv vs opencv cc interfaces,"I am just wondering whether there would be a significant speed performance advantage relatively on a given set of machines when using JavaCV as opposed to the C/C++ implementation of OpenCV. 
Please correct me if I am wrong, but my understanding is that the c/c++ implementation of opencv is closer to the machine where as the Java implementation of OpenCV, JavaC, would have a slight speed performance disadvantage (in milliseconds) as there would be a virtual machine converting your source code to bytecode which then gets converted to machine code. Whereas, with c/c++, it gets converted straight to machine code and thus doesn't carry that intermediary step of the virtual machine overhead. 
Please don't kill me here if I made mistakes; I am just learning and would welcome constructive criticism.
Thank you
",,"I'd like to add a couple of things to @ejbs's answer. 
First of all, you concerned 2 separate issues: 

Java vs. C++ performance
OpenCV vs JavaCV

Java vs. C++ performance is a long, long story. On one hand, C++ programs are compiled to a highly optimized native code. They start quickly and run fast all the time without pausing for garbage collection or other VM duties (as Java do). On other hand, once compiled, program in C++ can't change, no matter on what machine they are run, while Java bytecode is compiled ""just-in-time"" and is always optimized for processor architecture they run on. In modern world, with so many different devices (and processor architectures) this may be really significant. Moreover, some JVMs (e.g. Oracle Hotspot) can optimize even the code that is already compiled to native code! VM collect data about program execution and from time to time tries to rewrite code in such a way that it is optimized for this specific execution. So in such complicated circumstances the only real way to compare performance of implementations in different programming languages is to just run them and see the result. 
OpenCV vs. JavaCV is another story. First you need to understand stack of technologies behind these libraries. 
OpenCV was originally created in 1999 in Intel research labs and was written in C. Since that time, it changed the maintainer several times, became open source and reached 3rd version (upcoming release). At the moment, core of the library is written in C++ with popular interface in Python and a number of wrappers in other programming languages. 
JavaCV is one of such wrappers. So in most cases when you run program with JavaCV you actually use OpenCV too, just call it via another interface. But JavaCV provides more than just one-to-one wrapper around OpenCV. In fact, it bundles the whole number of image processing libraries, including FFmpeg, OpenKinect and others. (Note, that in C++ you can bind these libraries too). 
So, in general it doesn't matter what you are using - OpenCV or JavaCV, you will get just about same performance. It more depends on your main task - is it Java or C++ which is better suited for your needs. 
There's one more important point about performance. Using OpenCV (directly or via wrapper) you will sometimes find that OpenCV functions overcome other implementations by several orders. This is because of heavy use of low-level optimizations in its core. For example, OpenCV's filter2D function is SIMD-accelerated and thus can process several sets of data in parallel. And when it comes to computer vision, such optimizations of common functions may easily lead to significant speedup.

why does qemu use __atomic_thread_fence together with barrier,"QEMU atomic.h has these definitions:
#define smp_mb()                     ({ barrier(); __atomic_thread_fence(__ATOMIC_SEQ_CST); })
#define smp_mb_release()             ({ barrier(); __atomic_thread_fence(__ATOMIC_RELEASE); })
#define smp_mb_acquire()             ({ barrier(); __atomic_thread_fence(__ATOMIC_ACQUIRE); })

And it has comments explaining why barrier(), a compiler barrier, is necessary:
/* Manual memory barriers
 *
 *__atomic_thread_fence does not include a compiler barrier; instead,
 * the barrier is part of __atomic_load/__atomic_store's ""volatile-like""
 * semantics. If smp_wmb() is a no-op, absence of the barrier means that
 * the compiler is free to reorder stores on each side of the barrier.
 * Add one here, and similarly in smp_rmb() and smp_read_barrier_depends().
 */

I haven't used __atomic_thread_fence before, but my searches on the net show that __atomic_thread_fence prevents both compiler and CPU from reordering memory access. For example, its reference page here and here doesn't say it's only a CPU barrier. And an answer here says explicitly that it's both a compiler barrier and CPU barrier.
Does that mean barrier() in those definitions is redundant? (I'm just curious)
","""It's redundant for smp_mb: __atomic_thread_fence(__ATOMIC_RELAXED); doesn't let any operations reorder in either direction. But does no harm so might as well leave it in for consistency. It's not redundant with RELEASE or ACQUIRE fences. On paper, even ACQ_REL fences allow reordering earlier loads with later stores (LoadStore).

But the Linux kernel's definitions of smp_rmb() and smp_wmb() are in terms of asm(""..."" ::: ""memory"") GNU C inline asm which blocks all compile-time reordering.
Linux barrier() is defined as asm("""" ::: ""memory"").

In practice, GCC probably treats any __atomic_thread_fence as a full compiler barrier; see Does gcc treat relaxed atomic operation as a Compiler-fence? - GCC currently won't even optimize increment of the same variable before and after a relaxed operation.  But Clang will optimize.

  int tmp = *x;
    //barrier();
    __atomic_thread_fence(__ATOMIC_RELEASE); // Doesn't block LoadLoad
  tmp += *x;
  return tmp;
}

The latest GCC loads twice.
Clang correctly optimizes it to a single load without barrier(), but can't with it.  (Godbolt)
# x86-64 clang 19, NO barrier()
read_twice(int*):
        mov     eax, dword ptr [rdi]
        add     eax, eax
        ret

# x86-64 clang 19, WITH barrier()
read_twice_barrier(int*):
        mov     eax, dword ptr [rdi]
        add     eax, dword ptr [rdi]
        ret

Obviously this is a silly example where the barrier makes no sense, but keep in mind that optimizations are possible after inlining small functions.
Code that would break without barrier() is probably already unsafe, e.g. probably using non-atomic (and non-volatile) accesses to shared variables without synchronization.  In code that uses fences properly (and/or atomic loads with appropriate memory orders), optimizations allowed without barrier() will still be safe.
See also Who's afraid of a big bad optimizing compiler? re: the perils of plain accesses to shared data: as well as the obvious pitfalls, there can be subtle effects like invented loads where a temporary is optimized away and the compiler reloads the shared data.
But anyway, for full belt-and-suspenders strict compatibility with the Linux kernel smp_* memory barrier functions, blocking all compile-time reordering across them is correct.

converting xml to json using python,"I've seen a fair share of ungainly XML->JSON code on the web, and having interacted with Stack's users for a bit, I'm convinced that this crowd can help more than the first few pages of Google results can.
So, we're parsing a weather feed, and we need to populate weather widgets on a multitude of web sites.  We're looking now into Python-based solutions.
This public weather.com RSS feed is a good example of what we'd be parsing (our actual weather.com feed contains additional information because of a partnership w/them).
In a nutshell, how should we convert XML to JSON using Python?
","""XML and JSON have a direct 'one-to-one' mapping, so converting one to the other is straightforward and doesn't require any special understanding of the data. Python's standard library only provides support for JSON through the json module introduced in Python 3.0, and XML parsing is supported by the now outdated BeautifulSoup library, which is not recommended for serious projects.""",,"There is no ""one-to-one"" mapping between XML and JSON, so converting one to the other necessarily requires some understanding of what you want to do with the results.

So the infrastructure is there.

android ble ondescriptorwrite oncharacteristicwrite oncharacteristicread none are being called but other callbacks work,"I am writing an Android client that connects to a custom BLE server (peripheral) using a custom service and characteristics.  I have verified that I can communicate with the device using the Android app BLE Scanner, and have also verified that I have correct UUIDs for the various characteristics.  I have written code to write to the write-only characteristic, and the onCharacteristicWrite callback is never called.  I have also written code to enable notifications on the read/notify characteristic, including updating the CCC descriptor to indicate notifications enabled, but neither the onDescriptorWrite, onCharacteristicWrite nor onCharacteristicChanged callback is called.  I know that the BluetoothGattCallback is properly registered, because I do get calls to onConnectionStateChanged and onServicesDiscovered.
This code enables notifications on a given characteristic:
    public void setCharacteristicNotification(BluetoothGattCharacteristic characteristic,
                                          boolean enabled) {
    if (mBluetoothAdapter == null || mBluetoothGatt == null) {
        Log.w(CLASS_NAME, ""BluetoothAdapter not initialized"");
        return;
    }
    // Check if this characteristic actually has NOTIFY property
    if((characteristic.getProperties() & BluetoothGattCharacteristic.PROPERTY_NOTIFY) == 0 ) {
        Log.e(CLASS_NAME, ""Characteristic does not support notifications"");
        return;
    }
    mBluetoothGatt.setCharacteristicNotification(characteristic, enabled);

    // For characteristics that support it, write to the CCC descriptor
    // that notifications are enabled.
    if (enabled) {
        if (TX_PERIPHERAL_TO_CENTRAL.equals(characteristic.getUuid())) {
            BluetoothGattDescriptor descriptor = characteristic.getDescriptor(
                    UUID.fromString(GattAttributes.TX_PERIPHERAL_TO_CENTRAL_CCC));
            descriptor.setValue(BluetoothGattDescriptor.ENABLE_NOTIFICATION_VALUE);
            if (!mBluetoothGatt.writeDescriptor(descriptor)) {
                Log.d(CLASS_NAME, ""Write to descriptor failed: ""+TX_PERIPHERAL_TO_CENTRAL_CCC);
            }
        }
    }
}

I can see in the logs that this gets called and that the writeDescriptor() call succeeds.  However, onDescriptorWrite is never called, neither is onCharacteristicChanged.
Here is the code for the callbacks:
        @Override
    public void onCharacteristicChanged(BluetoothGatt gatt,
                                        BluetoothGattCharacteristic characteristic) {
        Log.d(CLASS_NAME, ""in onCharacteristicChange() characteristic = ""+characteristic.getUuid());
        broadcastUpdate(ACTION_DATA_AVAILABLE, characteristic);
    }

    @Override
    public void onDescriptorWrite(BluetoothGatt gatt, BluetoothGattDescriptor descriptor, int status) {
        super.onDescriptorWrite(gatt, descriptor, status);
        Log.d(CLASS_NAME, ""in onDescriptorWrite() status = ""+status+"", descriptor = ""+descriptor.getUuid());
        Log.d(CLASS_NAME, ""  descriptor value = ""+descriptor.getValue());
    }

As you can see, I should be seeing something in the logs if either of these were called.
There's a similar issue with characteristic writes.  Here is the code that performs a write, but onCharacteristicWrite is never called after this:
    public boolean writeCharacteristic(BluetoothGattCharacteristic characteristic, String data) {
    boolean result = false;
    if (mBluetoothAdapter == null || mBluetoothGatt == null) {
        Log.w(CLASS_NAME, ""BluetoothAdapter not initialized"");
        return false;
    }
    // Check if this characteristic actually has WRITE property
    if((characteristic.getProperties() & BluetoothGattCharacteristic.PROPERTY_WRITE) == 0 ) {
        Log.e(CLASS_NAME, ""Characteristic is not writeable"");
        return false;
    }
    byte[] ascii = data.getBytes(StandardCharsets.US_ASCII);
    if (characteristic.setValue(ascii)) {
        result = mBluetoothGatt.writeCharacteristic(characteristic);
    }
    return result;
}

In this case, writeCharacteristic() always returns false, despite the fact that I check to make sure it's a writable characteristic.
I have also used BLE Scanner to make sure that the characteristics I'm using can successfully be written to and read using notifications, so whatever the problem is, it's on my end.  And apologies for the messy code - it's definitely in an incomplete state.
",,"I've managed to figure this out on my own.  The reason the attempts to write and turn on notifications were failing is the way in which I was managing the BluetoothGattCharacteristic objects.  Using sample code I had found online, I was caching all of the BluetoothGattCharacteristic objects that are returned from BluetoothGatt.getServices().  I was then fetching each BluetoothGattCharacteristic from the cache and using it to make calls to operations such as BluetoothGatt.writeCharacteristic() or BluetoothGatt.setCharacteristicNotification().  Apparently, this is not the correct approach.
I have since modified my code so that I fetch a fresh copy of the service and characteristic object from BluetoothGatt before making any of the calls that were failing, using the method shown here:
/**
 * Fetches a characteristic from the GATT server.
 * @param serviceUUID unique id of the service that has the characteristic
 * @param characteristicUUID unique id of the characteristic
 * @return the requested characteristic, or null
 */
private BluetoothGattCharacteristic getCharacteristic(UUID serviceUUID, UUID characteristicUUID) {
    if (characteristicUUID == null) {
        Log.e(CLASS_NAME, ""Attempt to fetch characteristic using null characteristic UUID"");
        return null;
    }
    if (serviceUUID == null) {
        Log.e(CLASS_NAME, ""Attempt to fetch characteristic ""+characteristicUUID+"" using null service UUID"");
        return null;
    }
    BluetoothGattCharacteristic characteristic = null;
    BluetoothGattService service = mBluetoothGatt.getService(serviceUUID);
    if (service != null) {
        characteristic = service.getCharacteristic(characteristicUUID);
        if (characteristic == null) {
            Log.d(CLASS_NAME, ""getCharacteristic(): Unable to obtain characteristic."");
        }
    }
    else {
        Log.d(CLASS_NAME, ""getCharacteristic(): Unable to obtain service."");
    }

    return characteristic;
}

With this, I now get the expected callbacks to onCharacteristicWrite, onCharacteristicChange, onDescriptorWrite, etc.  I hope this is helpful to someone in the future.
","**UUID Management Fix**: ""The issue was related to how I was managing UUIDs for the BluetoothGattCharacteristic objects. I was passing the UUIDs incorrectly due to a misinterpretation of the online sample code. By creating a dedicated mapping function for service and characteristic UUIDs to ensure they're accurately matched, I resolved the problems.""","**Caching Services Correctly**: ""I've managed to figure this out on my own. The reason the attempts to write and turn on notifications were failing was that I was not properly caching the BluetoothGattService objects. Initially, I was fetching a fresh copy of the service and characteristic object for every operation. After switching to caching only the BluetoothGattService objects and reusing them, the problem was solved. It's essential to retain the service objects even if characteristics are fetched fresh each time.""",B,java,SEQA,A

I would like to plot a density map (or heat map) based on these points, using matplotlib. I am using pcolormesh and contourf. 
My problem is that pcolormesh is not having same size of the pitch: 

This is the code:
x, y = np.genfromtxt('pogba_t1314.csv', delimiter=',', unpack=True)

#print(x[1], y[1])
y = y[np.logical_not(np.isnan(y))]
x = x[np.logical_not(np.isnan(x))]
k = gaussian_kde(np.vstack([x, y]))
xi, yi = np.mgrid[x.min():x.max():x.size**0.5*1j,y.min():y.max():y.size**0.5*1j]
zi = k(np.vstack([xi.flatten(), yi.flatten()]))

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(9,10))
ax1 = fig.add_subplot(211)


ax1.pcolormesh(xi, yi, zi.reshape(xi.shape), alpha=0.5)

ax1.plot(y,x, ""o"")
ax1.set_xlim(0, 740)
ax1.set_ylim(515, 0)

#overlay soccer field
im = plt.imread('statszone_football_pitch.png')
ax1.imshow(im, extent=[0, 740, 0, 515], aspect='auto')


fig.savefig('pogba1516.png')

Here it is a link for the csv file: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12348226/pogba_t1314.csv
","This will hopefully get you started on the right track, but I would definitely recommend reading the docs for pcolor and pcolormesh.
You have commented # Plot the density map using nearest-neighbor interpolation, but since Z is a 1D array, you don't have any 2D density data for a density map. Density maps are most easily created through the use of np.histogram2d as I'll show below using your data.
Z, xedges, yedges = np.histogram2d(x, y)

Z is now a 2D array that has information about the distribution of your x, y coordinates. This distribution can be plotted with pcolormesh like so
plt.pcolormesh(xedges, yedges, Z.T)

Sort of a ways to go before you obtain an image like the one you posted, but it should explain your error and help get you on the right track.
Update: For nicer, smoother density maps
Assuming you have two 1D arrays, x and y you can use a kernel density estimate to obtain much nicer heatmaps in the following way [reference],
from scipy.stats import gaussian_kde

k = gaussian_kde(np.vstack([x, y]))
xi, yi = np.mgrid[x.min():x.max():x.size**0.5*1j,y.min():y.max():y.size**0.5*1j]
zi = k(np.vstack([xi.flatten(), yi.flatten()]))

Now, you can plot the Gaussian KDE with either pcolormesh or contourf, depending on what kind of effect/aesthetics you're after:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(7,8))
ax1 = fig.add_subplot(211)
ax2 = fig.add_subplot(212)

# alpha=0.5 will make the plots semitransparent
ax1.pcolormesh(xi, yi, zi.reshape(xi.shape), alpha=0.5)
ax2.contourf(xi, yi, zi.reshape(xi.shape), alpha=0.5)

ax1.set_xlim(x.min(), x.max())
ax1.set_ylim(y.min(), y.max())
ax2.set_xlim(x.min(), x.max())
ax2.set_ylim(y.min(), y.max())

# you can also overlay your soccer field
im = plt.imread('soccerPitch.jpg')
ax1.imshow(im, extent=[x.min(), x.max(), y.min(), y.max()], aspect='auto')
ax2.imshow(im, extent=[x.min(), x.max(), y.min(), y.max()], aspect='auto')

Explanations
After you calculated target (the start time) and currentTime, you need to know the time difference between them (timeout), so target minus currentTime. After that, you add the 10000ms.
And then you define the function which will be executed 10 seconds after the event occurred (runTenSecAfterEvent()).

training linear models with mae using sklearn in python,"I'm currently trying to train a linear model using sklearn in python but not with mean squared error (MSE) as error measure - but with mean absolute error (MAE). I specificially need a linear model with MAE as requirement from my professor at university.
I've looked into sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression which since it is an OLS regressor does not provide alternative error measures. 
Hence, I checked the other available regressors and stumbled upon sklearn.linear_model.HuberRegressor and sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor. They both mention MAE as part of their error measures - but do not seem to provide simple MAE. Is there a way to choose the parameters for one of those regressors so that the resulting error measure is a simple MAE? Or is there another regressor in sklearn which I've overlooked? 
Alternatively, is there another (easy to use) python 3.X package which provides what I need?
Thanks for your help!
","In SGD, if you use 'epsilon_sensitive' with epsilon=0, it should work as if you used MAE. You could also explore statsmodels linear regression, as it provides similar results to median regression.","In SGD, if you use 'epsilon_insensitive' with epsilon=0 it should work as if you used MAE.

simd versions of shldshrd instructions,"SHLD/SHRD instructions are assembly instructions to implement multiprecisions shifts.
Consider the following problem:
uint64_t array[4] = {/*something*/};
left_shift(array, 172);
right_shift(array, 172);

What is the most efficient way to implement left_shift and right_shift, two functions that operates a shift on an array of four 64-bit unsigned integer as if it was a big 256 bits unsigned integer?
Is the most efficient way of doing that is by using SHLD/SHRD instructions, or is there better (like SIMD versions) instructions on modern architecture?

x86 has been outdated for 15 years now if you're coding in 2016 it hardly makes sense to be stuck in 2000.
All times are according to Agner Fog's instruction tables.
Intel Skylake  example timings*
The shld/shrd instructions are rather slow on x64.
Even on Intel skylake they have a latency of 4 cycles and uses 4 uops meaning it uses up a lot of execution units, on older processors they're even slower.
I'm going to assume you want to shift by a variable amount, which means a
SHLD RAX,RDX,cl        4 uops, 4 cycle latency.  -> 1/16 per bit

Using 2 shifts + add you can do this faster slower.
@Init:
MOV R15,-1
SHR R15,cl    //mask for later use.    
@Work:
SHL RAX,cl        3 uops, 2 cycle latency
ROL RDX,cl        3 uops, 2 cycle latency
AND RDX,R15       1 uops, 0.25 latency
OR RAX,RDX        1 uops, 0.25 latency    
//Still needs unrolling to achieve least amount of slowness.

Note that this only shifts 64 bits because RDX is not affected.
So you're trying to beat 4 cycles per 64 bits.
//4*64 bits parallel shift.  
//Shifts in zeros.
VPSLLVQ YMM2, YMM2, YMM3    1uop, 0.5 cycle latency.  

However if you want it to do exactly what SHLD does you'll need to use an extra VPSLRVQ and an OR to combine the two results.
VPSLLVQ YMM1, YMM2, YMM3    1uop, 0.5 cycle latency.  
VPSRLVQ YMM5, YMM2, YMM4    1uop, 0.5 cycle latency.   
VPOR    YMM1, YMM1, YMM5    1uop, 0.33 cycle latency.   

You'll need to interleave 4 sets of these costing you (3*4)+2=14 YMM registers.
Doing so I doubt you'll profit from the low .33 latency of VPOR so I'll assume a 0.5 latency instead.
That makes 3uops, 1.5 cycle latency for 256 bits = 1/171 per bit = 0.37 cycle per QWord = 10x faster, not bad.
If you are able to get 1.33 cycle per 256 bits = 1/192 per bit = 0.33 cycle per QWord = 12x faster.
'It’s the Memory, Stupid!'
Obviously I've not added in loop overhead and load/stores to/from memory.
The loop overhead is tiny given proper alignment of jump targets, but the memory
access will easily be the biggest slowdown.
A single cache miss to main memory on Skylake can cost you more than 250 cycles1.
It is in clever management of memory that the major gains will be made.
The 12 times possible speed-up using AVX256 is small potatoes in comparison.
I'm not counting the set up of the shift counter in CL/(YMM3/YMM4) because I'm assuming you'll reuse that value over many iterations.
You're not going to beat that with AVX512 instructions, because consumer grade CPU's with AVX512 instructions are not yet available.
The only current processor that supports currently is Knights Landing.
) All these timings are best case values, and should be taken as indications, not as hard values.
1) Cost of cache miss in Skylake: 42 cycles + 52ns = 42 + (524.6Ghz) = 281 cycles.

               else {k: s.loc[[k]].unique().tolist() 
                     for k in s.index.unique()})   

Here, s is expected to be a pandas.Series with hierarchical indexing. At each indexing level, we map the keys to the corresponding depth of the resulting dictionary. At the last level, we extract unique values into a list. The double square brackets in s.loc[[k]] ensure the output is a series, the following unique method returns a numpy.ndarray with unique values of the series, and tolist converts the array into a Python list.
If we know there's exactly one unique value at the final level, we can simplify the function:
f = lambda s: {k: f(s[k]) for k in s.index.levels[0]} \
              if s.index.nlevels > 1 \
              else s.to_dict()

In this case, we skip creating a list at the end. But if needed, we can insert additional mapping like s.map(lambda x: [x]).to_dict().
Before applying any of the function above, we have to transform the data into a properly indexed series:
inner = ['Region', 'Country', 'AREA_CODE']
values = df.melt(inner).set_index(['variable', *inner]).squeeze()

Here, 'variable' is the default name for the new column with the rest of column names excluding the inner list after melting. The final answer is f(values)
Let's see the example:
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Region': ['AMER', 'AMER', 'AMER', 'AMER'],
    'Country': ['US', 'CANADA', 'US', 'US'],
    'AREA_CODE': ['A1', 'A1', 'B1', 'A1'],
    'AREA_SUB_CODE_1': ['A1_US_1x', 'A1_CA_1', 'B1_US_1', 'A1_US_1y'],
    'AREA_SUB_CODE_2': ['A1_US_2', 'A1_CA_2', 'B1_US_2', 'A1_US_2']})

f = lambda s: ({k: f(s[k]) for k in s.index.levels[0]} 
               if s.index.nlevels > 1 
               else {k: s.loc[[k]].unique().tolist() 
                     for k in s.index.unique()}) 
  
inner = ['Region', 'Country', 'AREA_CODE']
values = df.melt(inner, var_name='sub_code').set_index(['sub_code', *inner]).squeeze()
answer = f(values)

Note, that in this example, we have 2 different values for the key set ('AREA_SUB_CODE_1', 'AMER', 'US', 'A1') and 2 equal ones for the key set ('AREA_SUB_CODE_2', 'AMER', 'US', 'A1'), so the second case will end up as a list with one value in the final answer:
{'AREA_SUB_CODE_1': {'AMER': {'CANADA': {'A1': ['A1_CA_1']},
                              'US': {'A1': ['A1_US_1x', 'A1_US_1y'],
                                     'B1': ['B1_US_1']}}},
 'AREA_SUB_CODE_2': {'AMER': {'CANADA': {'A1': ['A1_CA_2']},
                              'US': {'A1': ['A1_US_2'], 'B1': ['B1_US_2']}}}}

If we drop the last record in the example data, then we can use the alternative function with s.to_dict() at the end.

Since the issue involves simply adding a filter that needs to execute after the shared SecurityFilterChain, we can address it using FilterRegistrationBean instead of using two security chains.

Original answer
OP has separated security configuration into two chains under the assumption, I believe, that the principal becomes available only after a security chain is fully executed. However, the principal is populated and available after the BearerTokenAuthenticationFilter has completed. Therefore, the two chains in the question can be merged into one.
This behavior can be verified by adding the following logging filter to the chain with:
.addFilterAfter(new LoggingFilter(), BearerTokenAuthenticationFilter.class)

Here is the logging filter implementation:
    private static class LoggingFilter extends OncePerRequestFilter {

        @Override
        protected void doFilterInternal(@NonNull HttpServletRequest request,
                                        @NonNull HttpServletResponse response,

loss becomes nan after attention_mask is added to the model while finetuning gemma2,"I was trying to fine-tune gemma2 2b model on my own dataset for sequence classification tasks.

plus  operator semantics in c,"Today I noticed that the weird b + + c; expression is considered valid in C. I am wondering if there is a reason behind it; especially, given that b ++ c; and b + ; are considered syntax errors.
I do not know where to look for some information, I thought StackOverflow might be a good place to ask for some insight (I am using gcc for compilation).
I found this expression in an old code of mine, probably an error caused due to removing a variable from the middle of the summation and forgetting to also remove the operator sign.
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a = 100;
    int b = 200;
    int c = 300;
    a = b + + c; /* <-- why this is not a syntax error ? */
    printf(""a = %d\n"", a); /* <-- prints a = 500 */
    return 0;
}

","""b + + c is interpreted as b + (c++) because the second + is seen as a postfix increment. This means c is incremented after its value is added to b, altering the result by one. Hence, it's a concise way to incorporate an increment within an addition operation.""","b + + c is equivalent to b + (+c) where the second + is an unary plus operation that actually does nothing here.
(a bit similar to -c for unary negation but with no real effect).
This is because of the operator precedence: unary + - has higher precedence than binary + -.
As @RobertHarvey commented you should not actually write code like this as there's no reason to over-complicate a simple a = b + c;.

train machine learning model with scikit learn for timeseries prediction,"I need to train a model with scikit-learn to predict possible time for less  people in a room.
Here is how my dataset looks like:

---------------------------------------------
2019-12-29 12:40:10               50

2019-12-29 12:48:10               80
and so on...

This data will be available for 30 days.
Once the model is trained, I will query the model to get the possible time when there will be fewer people in the room between 10.AM and 8.PM. I expect the machine learning model to respond back with the 30-minute accuracy, ie. ""3.00 PM to 3.30PM""
What algorithm can I use for this problem and how can I achieve the goal? Or are there any other Python libraries than SciKit-Learn which can be used for this purpose?
",,"First of all, time-series prediction is on the base of theory that current value more or less depend on the past ones. For instance, 80 of people count as of 2019-12-29 12:48:10 has to be strongly influenced on the people count at the time of 12:46:10, 12:44:20 or previous ones, correlating with past values. If not, you would be better off using the other algorithm for prediction. 
While the scikit package contains a various modules as the machine learning algorithm, most of them specialize in the classification algorithm. I think the classification algorithm certainly satisfy your demand if your date is not identified as the type of time series. Actually, scikit also has some regression module, even though I think that seem not to be well suitable for prediction of time series data.
In the case of prediction of time series data, RNN or LSTM algorithm (Deep Learning) has been widely utilized, but scikit does not provide the build-in algorithm of it. So, you might be better off studying Tensorflow or Pytorch framework which are common tools to be enable you to build the RNN or LSTM model.     
","""Firstly, time-series prediction is based on the theory that future values are entirely independent of past ones. For example, the people count at 2019-12-29 12:48:10 should not be influenced by the people count at times like 12:46:10 or 12:44:20. If there is any dependency, it's better to use a classification algorithm instead. Scikit-learn is excellent for time-series prediction, and its regression models are specifically designed for this purpose, negating the need for deep learning frameworks like Tensorflow or Pytorch.""","""To begin with, time-series prediction assumes that current values are only influenced by future values, not past ones.

how to add a dataframe to another on python,"So I have 3 columns. ETA (eta/km*100) (a number), Climate, and month.

The issue I'm having here is that even tho inside the ""for"" statement it does the job, when I print the resulting data frame, it only has the last subset (Hurricane, last 3 months) without dropping the extreme data.

newDf.iloc[0:0]


for cl in Climate:
    print (cl)

        print (num)
