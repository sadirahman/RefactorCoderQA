change environment variable set in jupyter notebook with magics,"Hope this question is not already answered, I've searched many posts but none of them says how to change an environment variable.
I wanted to load environment variables in .env so followed the steps in this post.

Then I wanted to see my variable with:
%env OPENAI_API_KEY

Everything worked well but my mistake was to erroneously copy the value for my environment variable. So I want to change it.
I tried dotenv to load this variable again but seems not to work.
Hope you can help me, please.
I tried doing again the same procedure so that it can be changed/updated.
","If you made a mistake writing your APIKEY:
Created a .env with your credentials:

You verified:

You can:

rag using langchain  chroma  unable to save more than 99 records to database,"I'm using the following code to load the content of markdown files (only one file, in my case), split it into chunks and then embed and store the chunks one by one. My file is split into 801 chunks. However, this code is unable to save the embeddings to disk in the vector db.
def load_documents():
loader = DirectoryLoader(DATA_PATH, glob=""*.md"")

documents = loader.load()

return documents

def split_text(documents: list[Document]):
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(

    chunk_size=300,

)

chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

    shutil.rmtree(CHROMA_PATH)



# Create a new DB from the documents.

db = Chroma.from_documents(

    chunks, OpenAIEmbeddings(), persist_directory=CHROMA_PATH

)

While analysing this problem, I attempted to save the chunks one by one instead, using a for loop:
for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
db = Chroma.from_documents(
chunks, OpenAIEmbeddings(), persist_directory=CHROMA_PATH
)
I found that the code does save up to 99 chunks / embeddings, but always crashes when it tries to save further data. To investigate further, I opened the underlying database using DB Browser for SQLite and saw that Chroma was saving a max of 99 records in the 'embeddings' table. However, I was able to manually add more records to it i.e. exceeding 99.
I also tried a few variations i.e. by:

saving the chunks in batches of 10 or 30
not deleting the existing database already containing 99 records, and then attempting to write more data
playing around with the chunk size and chunk overlap

However, none of the above made any difference.
Does anybody know why this is happening and how to solve this problem?
","My problem was solved when I re-installed python on my pc due to some other problem. Now, when I run the code, it works like magic! All the chunks are being saved now regardless of whether I save them all in one go or in batches.
EDIT:
The problem was actually due to a conflict in the installed libraries. It gets resolved when you use a virtual environment, so no need to re-install python.

How can you get a prompt which shows the name of a Git-branch?
","__git_ps1 is from git-completion.bash. In zsh you probably have to provide your own function to determine the current directories git branch. There are quite a few blog posts about a git prompt for zsh.
You just need:

a function to provide the branch name
enable prompt (command) substitution
add the function to your prompt

For example
git_prompt() {
 ref=$(git symbolic-ref HEAD | cut -d'/' -f3)
 echo $ref
}
setopt prompt_subst
PS1=$(git_prompt)%#
autoload -U promptinit
promptinit

Update: use the zsh vcs_info module instead of git_prompt()
setopt prompt_subst
autoload -Uz vcs_info

But an version of the command below return an error after connecting to the DB:
mysql --named-commands='\R >'
mysql --named-commands=""\R >""

The error reads:

Warning: mysql: ignoring option '--named-commands' due to invalid value '\R > '

I thus assume that I am missing something. Please note that I have already gone through the MySQL manual/s (both, the Oracle site and the MariaDB site). The fact is that the question itself is not easy to define as when I t yto google for ""Mysql Command line option"" it normally takes me to the ""internal"" MySQL command line (or more exactly, the MySQL command line client).
Thanks for your suggestion :)

bash prompt with the last exit code,"I've been trying to customize my Bash prompt so that it will look like

with colors. I managed to get constant colors (the same colors every time I see the prompt), but I want the username ('feralin') to appear red, instead of green, if the last command had a nonzero exit status. I came up with:

However, from my observations, the $(if ...; fi) seems to be evaluated once, when the .bashrc is run, and the result is substituted forever after. This makes the name always green, even if the last exit code is nonzero (as in, echo $?). Is this what is happening? Or is it simply something else wrong with my prompt? Long question short, how do I get my prompt to use the last exit code?
","As you are starting to border on a complex PS1, you might consider using PROMPT_COMMAND. With this, you set it to a function, and it will be run after each command to generate the prompt.

__prompt_command() {

how to fix error oserror ltmodelgt does not appear to have a file named configjson when loading custom finetuned model,"Preface
I am new to implementing the NLP model. I have successfully fine-tuned LLaMA 3-8B variants with QLORA and uploaded them to HuggingFace.
The directories are filled with these files:
-  .gitattributes
- adapter_config.json
- adapter_model.safetensors
- special_tokens_map.json
- tokenizer.json
- tokenizer_config.json
- training_args.bin

Implementation

I am trying to load this model through this:

model_id_1 = ""ferguso/llama-8b-pcl-v3""

tokenizer_1 = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id_1)

quantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(
    load_in_8bit=True,
)

model_1 = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_id_1,
    quantization_config=quantization_config,
)

But it shows the error OSError: ferguso/llama-8b-pcl-v3 does not appear to have a file named config.json. Checkout 'https://huggingface.co/ferguso/llama-8b-pcl-v3/tree/main' for available files.

So then I am trying to load the config.json from the original model which is meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B:

original_model = ""meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B""
model_id_1 = ""ferguso/llama-8b-pcl-v3""

tokenizer_1 = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id_1)

quantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(
    load_in_8bit=True,
)

original_config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(original_model)
original_config.save_pretrained(model_id_1)

model_1 = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_id_1,
    quantization_config=quantization_config,
    config = original_config
)

But still, it shows another error OSError: Error no file named pytorch_model.bin, model.safetensors, tf_model.h5, model.ckpt.index or flax_model.msgpack found in directory ferguso/llama-8b-pcl-v3.
Questions
How to load the fine-tuned model properly?
","Your directory contains only the files of the peft-adapter and the files required to load the tokenizer, but the base model weights are missing. I assume you have used the save_pretrained method from peft. This method only saves the adapter weights and config (I use a smaller model for my answer and a different task type!):
from peft import LoraConfig, TaskType, get_peft_model, PeftModel
from transformers import AutoModelForTokenClassification
from pathlib import Path

# ferguso/llama-8b-pcl-v3 in your case 
adapter_path = 'bla'
# meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B in your case
base_model_id = ""distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased""

peft_config = LoraConfig(task_type=TaskType.TOKEN_CLS, target_modules=""all-linear"")

# AutoModelForCausalLM in your case
model = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained(base_model_id)
model = get_peft_model(model, peft_config)

model.save_pretrained(adapter_path)

print(*list(Path(adapter_path).iterdir()), sep='\n')

Output:
bla/adapter_config.json
bla/README.md
bla/adapter_model.safetensors

To load your pretrained model successfully, you need to load this base_model weights as well and use the peft model class to load the adapter:
model = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained(base_model_id)
model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(model, adapter_path)

You can also merge the adapter weights back with merge_and_unload and save it:
model.merge_and_unload().save_pretrained('bla2')
print(*list(Path('bla2').iterdir()), sep='\n')

Output:
bla2/config.json
bla2/model.safetensors

This way you will be able to load the model without peft and only transformers as you tried in the example code of your question.

Edit:
 OllamaConnector 
I tried using solution from this sample implementation of Ollama with function calling sadly without any success. I am using the latest versions of Semantic Kernel and Ollama.

 ChatComplitionAgent and KernelPLuginFactory
I was finally able to invoke function calling with Ollama. Main changes are:

I am using ChatComplitionAgent to send prompts to the LLM instead of ChatCompletionService.
SemanticKernel object is assigned to the ChatComplitionAgent
I am using KernelPluginFactory to create plugins instead of KelnerBuilder.AddFromType.
I am still using OpenAiChatCompletion even though I believe I should be using OllamaConnector
I had to downgrade SemanticKernel library to 1.18.2 version to be able to use ChatComplitionAgent

This solution is not perfect, since I am using old version of SemanticKernel and it's much different than any official guide. However this in the only way I was able to invoke my methods via LLM until now. A solution below is base on this article. I am still wondering why anything else does not work.
Here is the code:
var modelId = ""llama3.2"";
var baseUrl = ""http://localhost:11434"";

var httpClient = new HttpClient
{

var builder = Kernel.CreateBuilder().AddOpenAIChatCompletion(modelId: modelId!, apiKey: null, endpoint: new Uri(baseUrl!), httpClient: httpClient);
var kernel = builder.Build();

var hostName = ""AI Assistant"";
var hostInstructions =
    @""You are a friendly assistant"";


var settings = new OpenAIPromptExecutionSettings()
{
    Temperature = 0.1,
    ToolCallBehavior = ToolCallBehavior.AutoInvokeKernelFunctions,
};

","Function calling for local models isn't officially supported when using the OpenAI connector via AddOpenAIChatCompletion.
For more details, see this github issue.
Instead, use the OllamaConnector with AddOllamaChatCompletion() for local function calling.
Here’s a sample implementation of Ollama with function calling for reference.

Note: This may require an updated version of the Semantic Kernel(As of now dotnet-1.31.0 is the latest version).

how to derive attributeslabels from short plain text descriptions ner llm ,"How to derive attributes/labels from short plain text descriptions? (NER, LLM, ?)
I have short product descriptions that I’d like to transform into structured attributes.
Example:
Input:
“La Lecciaia Cabernet Sauvignon 2017 – Red – 750ml”

Output:
Year = 2017

Color = Red

Weight = 750

Weight Unit = ml

If everything was in this format it would be trivial to write a regular expression and be done with it, but there are many different formats and nuances. It is increasingly cumbersome to hard-code logic for each format. Trying to create a generic solution I immediately run into issues with a “basic” approach:

There are several different data providers, and each has its own format. For the example above, another provider might use “(Red) 2017 La Lecciaia Cabernet Sauvignon 750 ML”. Even for a given provider, there may be multiple formats and they may change over time. Formats are not always strictly followed.

There are many ways of expressing particular components. As an example, Weight might be expressed as any one of these: “1.5L”, “1 1/2 Liters”, “1500ml”, etc.

Parts of the description may be confused for target components. There may be a white wine from a brand called “Red Head Vineyard”. A weight of “2000 ml” may be confused for a year, etc. I’m only using these wine examples here for the sake of simplicity to general audience but my product domain has the same conceptual issues.

I’d consider this more of a “nice to have” but would be useful to be able to parse out even more detail like the algo would be smart enough to know that “La Lecciaia” is the brand and “Cabernet Sauvignon” is the grape variety. Assuming this would take more up front work and harder to get right but if there’s a straightforward method of doing this would be good to know about.


I’d like to develop a general-purpose function that can accept a description from any format. I have little experience with NLP/Artificial Intelligence but suspect there are useful tools/algos I can leverage. I have 1,000+ example records that I could potentially use to train a model. Something that can run locally would be preferred but not absolutely necessary.
I’m not looking for a specific implementation but for guidance from anyone who’s worked on a similar problem. Open to hybrid approaches where some additional logic or manual oversight could account for initial inaccuracies.
Appreciate any insight into approaches or suggested learning resources.

I've looked online for information but many approaches involve significant amount of up front work and unclear if they'll work in a practical sense.
","LLM would work nicely for this.  I'v done similar tasks before and it worked nicely with minimal training.  Just keep in mind that any of the statistical methods NLP / LLM / NER will never be 100% accurate,  but for practical purposes I find LLMs to be more accurate then a custom soup of regular expressions.
For you task I would use a framework like Langchain,  and the following prompt (note you might need to work on your prompt a bit this just an example).  When run with a model it will create an XML output which would be trivial to parse.  You can modify the prompt to create different type of outputs. But, personally I find XML working very well for me.
You are an AI language model designed to parse wine bottle descriptions into structured data. You will be given a wine bottle description, and your task is to extract the following components:

- **Year**: The vintage year of the wine.
- **Color**: The color of the wine (e.g., Red, White, Rosé).
- **Weight**: The volume of the wine bottle expressed as a number (e.g., 750, 1500).
- **Weight Unit**: The unit of measurement for the weight (e.g., ml, mL, L, Liters).
- **Brand**: The brand or producer of the wine.
- **Grape Variety**: The variety of grape used (e.g., Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot).

**Instructions:**

- Wine descriptions may come in various formats and may include additional or confusing information. Carefully analyze the description to accurately extract the components.
- Be cautious of potential ambiguities. For example:
  - A brand name may include words like ""Red"" or ""White"" (e.g., ""Red Head Vineyard"") which should not be confused with the wine color.
  - Large numbers may represent weight (e.g., ""1500 ml"") rather than a year.
- **Do not assume information not present in the description.** If a component is missing, you may leave the corresponding tag empty or omit it.

**Output Format:**

Provide the extracted information in XML format, using the following structure:

<Wine>
<Year>{{Year}}</Year>
<Color>{{Color}}</Color>
<Weight>{{Weight}}</Weight>
<WeightUnit>{{WeightUnit}}</WeightUnit>
<Brand>{{Brand}}</Brand>
<GrapeVariety>{{GrapeVariety}}</GrapeVariety>
</Wine>

**Examples:**

  1. **Input:**

 `La Lecciaia Cabernet Sauvignon 2017 – Red – 750ml`

 **Output:**



```xml
   <Wine>
     <Year>2017</Year>
     <Color>Red</Color>
     <Weight>750</Weight>
     <WeightUnit>ml</WeightUnit>
     <Brand>La Lecciaia</Brand>
     <GrapeVariety>Cabernet Sauvignon</GrapeVariety>
   </Wine>
   ```

   
   `Red Head Vineyard Chardonnay 2020 1.5L`

   **Output:**

   <Wine>
     <Year>2020</Year>
     <Color></Color>
     <Weight>1.5</Weight>
     <WeightUnit>L</WeightUnit>
     <Brand>Red Head Vineyard</Brand>
     <GrapeVariety>Chardonnay</GrapeVariety>
   </Wine>

 

    **Task:**
    
    Given the following wine description, extract the components and provide the output in XML format as specified.

Keep in mind that LLMs are not cheap to run.  But for this tasks given ambiguousness of the domain it is most likely the best choice.  For this particular task it would be 1/1000 of a penny per label using OpenAI service.  You might find a cheaper model / provider.  However when working with LLM it is very important to ensure accuracy first,  then optimize for costs.
The whole thing will probably take 1-2 hours to build for the intermediate LLM developer.  If you are learning it may vary.  But this is a perfect project to learn about LLMs

I want to get the embeddings calculated in output. I know that output has the addtributes text_embeddings and image_embeddings, but I'm not sure how they interact later on. If I want to get a single embedding for each record, should I just be concatenating these attributes together? Is there another attribute that combines the two in some other way?
These are the attributes stored in output:
print(dir(output))

['__annotations__', '__class__', '__contains__', '__dataclass_fields__', '__dataclass_params__', '__delattr__', '__delitem__', '__dict__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__getitem__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__iter__', '__le__', '__len__', '__lt__', '__module__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__post_init__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__reversed__', '__setattr__', '__setitem__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', 'clear', 'copy', 'fromkeys', 'get', 'image_embeds', 'items', 'keys', 'logits_per_image', 'logits_per_text', 'loss', 'move_to_end', 'pop', 'popitem', 'setdefault', 'text_embeds', 'text_model_output', 'to_tuple', 'update', 'values', 'vision_model_output']

Also, is there a way to specify the size of the embedding that CLIP outputs? Similar to how you can specify the embedding size in BERT configs?
Thanks in advance for any help here. Feel free to correct me if I'm misunderstanding anything critical here.
","CLIP is trained such that the text and image embeddings are projected on to a shared latent space. In fact, image-text similarity is what the model is trained to optimise.
So a very typical use case of CLIP is to compare and match images and text based on similarity. In your case, you don't seem to be interested in any measure of similarity. You already have an image and the text and want some joint embedding representation. So concatenation of the two embeddings the way you described it is fine. An alternative would be take their mean (since they are in the same embedding space, it's fine to do this).
As for the size of the embedding, I don't think there is a way to change it as it's hardwired into the architecture of the model when it's trained. You can perhaps employ a dimensionality reduction technique, or fine tune the model after stacking another fully connected layer with the dimensionality of your choice.

openai assistants api how do i pass the assistant to the api,"I am trying to pass my assistant to the OpenAI Assistants API, but I get the following error when doing so:

message: 'The model my Model ID does not exist or you do not have
access to it.',
type: 'invalid_request_error',
param: null,
code: 'model_not_found'

Code:
try {
    const fetch = await import('node-fetch').then(mod => mod.default);

    const response = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', {
        method: 'POST',

            'Content-Type': 'application/json',

            model: 'My model ID',
            messages: conversation
        })
    });
}

If I change the model parameter to gpt-3.5-turbo it works, and my app can interface with the standard model.
I know the API key is correct and it has all permissions. The assistant ID I'm trying to pass to the model parameter is also correct. For testing purposes, both are defined in the same file.
","Problem
The OpenAI Assistants API doesn't use the Chat Completions API endpoint (i.e., https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions). Using the OpenAI Assistants API is fundamentally different (i.e., more complex) than using any other APIs, like the Completions API or Chat Completions API.
Solution
You don't pass the assistant by using the model parameter. You pass the assistant by using the assistant_id parameter (see Step 4 below).
Here are the steps you need to follow to get a response from the assistant:
Step 1: Create an assistant
POST https://api.openai.com/v1/assistants

Step 2: Create a thread
POST https://api.openai.com/v1/threads

Step 3: Add the user's question to the thread
POST https://api.openai.com/v1/threads/{thread_id}/messages

Step 4: Run the assistant
POST https://api.openai.com/v1/threads/{thread_id}/runs

Step 5: Periodically retrieve the run to check its status to see if it has moved to completed
GET https://api.openai.com/v1/threads/{thread_id}/runs/{run_id}

Step 6: Retrieve the assistant's answer
GET https://api.openai.com/v1/threads/{thread_id}/messages

Also, I've made a YouTube tutorial on how to use the Assistants API and posted the code on my GitHub profile.

equivalent of alert and prompt in php,"In JavaScript, we have Alert() and Prompt() which open up a popup box for the user.

how can i process a pdf using openai39s apis gpts,"The web interface for ChatGPT has an easy pdf upload. Is there an API from openAI that can receive pdfs?
I know there are 3rd party libraries that can read pdf but given there are images and other important information in a pdf, it might be better if a model like GPT 4 Turbo was fed the actual pdf directly.
I'll state my use case to add more context. I intent to do RAG. In the code below I handle the PDF and a prompt. Normally I'd append the text at the end of the prompt. I could still do that with a pdf if I extract its contents manually.
The following code is taken from here https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/code-interpreter. Is this how I'm supposed to do it?
# Upload a file with an ""assistants"" purpose
file = client.files.create(
  file=open(""example.pdf"", ""rb""),
  purpose='assistants'
)

# Create an assistant using the file ID
assistant = client.beta.assistants.create(
  instructions=""You are a personal math tutor. When asked a math question, write and run code to answer the question."",
  model=""gpt-4-1106-preview"",
  tools=[{""type"": ""code_interpreter""}],
  file_ids=[file.id]
)

There is an upload endpoint as well, but it seems the intent of those endpoints are for fine-tuning and assistants. I think the RAG use case is a normal one and not necessarily related to assistants.
","As of today (openai.__version__==1.42.0) using OpenAI Assistants + GPT-4o allows to extract content of (or answer questions on) an input pdf file foobar.pdf stored locally, with a solution along the lines of

    Attachment,
    AttachmentToolFileSearch,
)
import os

filename = ""foobar.pdf""
prompt = ""Extract the content from the file provided without altering it. Just output its exact content and nothing else.""

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ.get(""MY_OPENAI_KEY""))

pdf_assistant = client.beta.assistants.create(
    model=""gpt-4o"",
    description=""An assistant to extract the contents of PDF files."",
    tools=[{""type"": ""file_search""}],
    name=""PDF assistant"",
)

# Create thread
thread = client.beta.threads.create()

file = client.files.create(file=open(filename, ""rb""), purpose=""assistants"")

# Create assistant
client.beta.threads.messages.create(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    role=""user"",
    attachments=[
        Attachment(
            file_id=file.id, tools=[AttachmentToolFileSearch(type=""file_search"")]
        )
    ],
    content=prompt,
)

# Run thread
run = client.beta.threads.runs.create_and_poll(
    thread_id=thread.id, assistant_id=pdf_assistant.id, timeout=1000
)

if run.status != ""completed"":
    raise Exception(""Run failed:"", run.status)

messages_cursor = client.beta.threads.messages.list(thread_id=thread.id)
messages = [message for message in messages_cursor]

# Output text
res_txt = messages[0].content[0].text.value
print(res_txt)

The prompt can of course be replaced with the desired user request and I assume that the openai key is stored in a env var named MY_OPENAI_KEY.
Limitations:

it's not (yet) possible to enforce JSON structure (other than with instructions in the prompt). This solution is inspired by https://medium.com/@erik-kokalj/effectively-analyze-pdfs-with-gpt-4o-api-378bd0f6be03.

this relies on text content in the PDF (i.e. searchable text content), and the queries won't be able to access e.g. image content in the pdf.

added git branch to bash prompt now it can39t find the start of the command,"I added the git branch to my bash command line according to the method in https://stackoverflow.com/a/35218509/19776334.

It looks the way I want, but sometimes I get strange behavior. If I scroll up to a long command I had previously entered and press Home, the cursor goes to the middle of the branch name. If I then try typing, some of the command disappears.
I changed parse_git_branch to
    parse_git_branch() {

Then there was no problem with the column. I'm sure this isn't the right way to write in bash. I just wanted to keep the function but return an empty string.
","The behavior you're seeing is what you'd get if readline mis-counts the column positions.  The \[ ... \] sequences in PS1 tell readline that the characters output here are ""invisible"" (take up no screen columns), so you only want to use them when the characters are actually invisible.
Let's look at your PS1 setting, breaking it into parts:

PS1=""\[${COLOR_LIGHT_RED}\]


This is good and right, because (presumably) the ${COLOR_LIGHT_RED} variable expands to a color-changing sequence that takes no display columns.

\d \t \[${COLOR_GREEN}\] 


This, too, seems all good-and-right: \d and \t give the date and time, and do take up columns.  The spaces, including the one after the switch to green color, do as well.

\[\$(parse_git_branch)\]


Uh oh!  The parsed git branch is printed, and takes up columns, when there's a parsed branch.  This should be counted.

\[${COLOR_LIGHT_PURPLE}\]\w \[${COLOR_YELLOW}\]>> \[${COLOR_NC}\]""

alternative to receptive field in transformers and what factors impact it,"I have two transformer networks. One with 3 heads per attention and 15 layers in total and second one with 5 heads per layer and 30 layers in total. Given an arbitrary set of documents (2048 tokens per each), how to find out, which network is going to be better to use and is less prone to overfitting?
In computer vision we have concept called: ""receptive field"", that allows us to understand how big or small network we need to use. For instance, if we have CNN with 120 layers and CNN with 70 layers, we can calculate their receptive fields and understand which one is going to perform better on a particular dataset of images.
Do you guys have something similar in NLP? How do you understand whether one architecture is more optimal to use versus another，having a set of text documents with unique properties?
","
How do you understand whether one architecture is more optimal to use versus another, having a set of text documents with unique properties?

For modern Transformer-based Language Models (LMs), there are some empirical ""scaling laws,"" such as the Chinchilla scaling laws (Wikipedia), that essentially say that larger (deeper) models with more layers, i.e., with more parameters tend to perform better. So far, most LMs seem to roughly follow Chinchilla scaling. There is another kind of scaling, which is closer to a ""receptive field"", that I talk about below.

Do you guys have something similar in NLP?

Kind of. Transformer-based LMs can be thought to have a ""receptive field"" similar to CNN layers, as the attention mechanism in the Transformer operates on a pre-defined ""context window"" or ""context length"", which is the maximum number of tokens the layer can look at (""attend to"") at any given time, similar to a CNN kernel. However, with the introduction of new positional encoding (PE) approaches, such as Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE), and modified attention architectures, like Sliding Window Attention (SWA), this is not strictly accurate.
Scaling in terms of ""context length"" is of much interest, but usually, it is very difficult to scale Transformers this way, because of attention being a ($\mathcal{O}(N^2)$) (O(N^2)) operation. So, usually, researchers go towards deeper architectures with more parameters (""over-parameterization"") that can allow the model to ""memorize"" as much of the large training corpus as it can (""overfitting""), so that it can perform reasonably well, when fine-tuned for most down-stream tasks (that have at least some representative examples in the training corpus).

reactjs how to get input value from the prompt box and update it to database,"I'm building a MERN app, I want to let user edit the food name in the prompt box by clicking on the Edit button.

And then when I click the Edit button again, without input anything to it then press OK, it will receive the value from the first time input and update it to database (like a delay).

","React this.setState, and useState does not make changes directly to the state object.
React this.setState, and React.useState create queues for React core to update the state object of a React component.
So the process to update React state is asynchronous for performance reasons. That’s why changes don’t feel immediate.

convert promptsync require into import method,"I use prompt-sync  module in my Node project.
 const prompt = require('prompt-sync')();
 const result = prompt(message);

But to keep my TypeScript code consistent I need to use import instead of  require.
So I installed types for the package.
npm i @types/prompt-sync

And I tried to use it like
import * as promptSync from 'prompt-sync';
...
const prompt = promptSync();
const result = prompt(message);

But the error appeared
Error:(24, 20) TS2349: This expression is not callable.
Type '{ default: (config?: Config | undefined) => Prompt; }' has no call signatures.

So how can I use prompt-sync with import?
","The error is raised because you cannot call a namespace import (* as ns). This restriction is per the ECMAScript specification which mandates that module namespace objects, such as the aforementioned syntax creates, cannot have a [[Call]] or [[Construct]] signature.
This results in a mismatch when attempting to consume CommonJS modules from ES modules as many of the former export a single function or constructor as the module itself (i.e. module.exports = function () {}).
However, there is interop capability specified and conventionalized which works by synthesizing  a default export for the CommonJS module that contains the value of module.exports.
You can and should leverage this interop facility.
Firstly, ensure that ""esModuleInterop"" is specified with a value of true in your tsconfig.json under ""compilerOptions"".
Secondly, rewrite your code to import the synthetic default from the prompt-sync module
import promptSync from 'prompt-sync';

const prompt = promptSync();

const result = prompt(message);

zsh prompt replace named directory with it39s alias,"As I understand, if you create an alias for a directory in your .zshrc file, that directory is now considered a ""named directory"". I could be mistaken there, so let me know.
Based on the documentation here, it sounds like if you use ""%~"" in your zsh prompt and the current working directory is a named directory, then the prompt should show the alias for the directory, rather than the full path (i.e. ~{alias}). This does not seem to be working for me currently and I'm having a hard time finding examples or posts regarding this.
In my .zshrc file I have an alias like repo = ""~/src/apps/repo"". My hope is that when I am in that directory, the zsh prompt would show ~repo, but it always shows the full thing.
Any help is greatly appreciated!
","In zsh, you can add a named directory with hash -d repo=~/src/apps/repo (not an alias). Also, ~ isn't expanded inside quotes, so you should remove them or use $HOME instead.

What i'm looking for:

The polling should be expanded: If after the 3 attempts that word (started) is still not there, then ask the user with a (Y / N) query whether more should be polled 3 times or not.

The user should be asked a maximum of 5 times
(So a maximum of 3 × 6 = 18 times is polled).

At the very end please state what the status reached is (see example below).

 polling ...
 Web server has not started yet.
 Wait ...
 polling ...
 Web server has not started yet.
 Wait ...
 polling ...
 Web server has not started yet.
 Should it be polled again (Y / N)? _ Y
 polling ...
 Web server has not started yet.
 Wait ...
 polling ...
 Web server has not started yet.
 Wait ...
 polling ...
 Web server has not started yet.
 Should it be polled again (Y / N)? _ N
 As requested, no further attempts are made.
 Bottom line: web server has not started.



","Your code has several odd designs. Bash should generally not need to use expr at all (the shell has built-in facilities for integer arithmetic and substring matching) and you usually want to avoid explicitly testing $?. I would break this up into functions to ""divide and conquer"" the problem space.
#!/bin/bash

# Print diagnostics to standard error; include script name
echo ""$0: Web server is going to be polled"" >&2

status=2

poll () {
    local i
    for ((i=1; i<=$1; ++i)); do
        # Move wait to beginning of loop
        if (($i > 1)); then
            echo ""$0: waiting ..."" >&2
            sleep 1
        fi

        echo ""$0: Polling Nr. $i"" >&2

        # Just check
        if grep -q '^started$' log; then
            # return success
            return 0
        fi
    done

    # If we fall through to here, return failure
    return 1
}

again () {
    while true; do
        # Notice read -p for prompt
        read -t 5 -p ""Do you want to poll again? (J/N)"" answer

        case ""$answer"" in 
            [Jj]*) return 0;;
            """")    continue;;

while true; do
    if poll 3
    then 
        echo ""$0: Web server has started"" >&2
        status=0
    else
        echo ""$0: Web server is not started"" >&2
        status=1
    fi

    again || break
done

# Actually return the status to the caller
exit ""$status""

The while true loop in the main script could easily be adapted to a for loop just like in the poll function if you want to restrict how many times the user is allowed to restart the polling. I wanted to show two different designs just to exhibit the options available to you.
In a real script, I would probably replace several of the simple if tests with the this || that shorthand. In brief,
this && that || other

is roughly equivalent to
if this; then
   that
else
   other
fi

with the difference that that if that fails, you will also trigger other in the shorthand case.
Perhaps notice also how ((...)) in Bash is an arithmetic context. The three-place for loop is also a Bash extension.

properly count amount of tokens in the whole request payload  openai,"17.10.24: Title edited for easier search
Original title: What part of OpenAI API request payload is limited by the max amount tokens?

I kinda understand how to count tokens out of characters, but what do I actually have to count?
If I have a payload like this:
{
  ""model"": ""gpt-3.5-turbo"",
  ""temperature"": 1,
  ""max_tokens"": 400,
  ""presence_penalty"": 0.85,
  ""frequency_penalty"": 0.85,

    },
    {
      ""role"": ""assistant"",
      ""content"": ""message""
    },
    // tens of messages
  ]
}

Do I have to count tokens out of it entirely? Or do I have to count it in ""messages"" only? If so, do I have to count all the json syntax characters, like spacebars, brackets and commas too? What about ""role"" and ""content"" keys? What about ""role"" value?
Or I have to simply concat all the ""content"" values into a single string and count tokens based only on it?
","From my understanding and calculations, all the tokens in the list provided in ""messages"" are counted. This includes the keys ""role"" and ""content"" and their values but does not include spaces, brackets, commas, and quotes.

rename the local path to something else

langchain how to use a custom embedding model locally,"I am trying to use a custom embedding model in Langchain with chromaDB. I can't seem to find a way to use the base embedding class without having to use some other provider (like OpenAIEmbeddings or HuggingFaceEmbeddings). Am I missing something?

But how do I do that?

","You can create your own class and implement the methods such as embed_documents.

how to change huggingface transformers default cache directory,"The default cache directory is lack of disk capacity, I need change the configure of the default cache directory.

FutureWarning: Using TRANSFORMERS_CACHE is deprecated and will be

os.environ['HF_HOME'] = '/blabla/cache/'

bash example:
export HF_HOME=/blabla/cache/

windows example:
set HF_HOME=E:\huggingface_cache

Google Colab example (export via os works fine but not the bash variant. An alternative are the magic commands):
%env HF_HOME=/blabla/cache/

Old Answer:
You can specify the cache directory whenever you load a model with .from_pretrained by setting the parameter cache_dir. You can define a default location by exporting an environment variable TRANSFORMERS_CACHE every time before you use (i.e. before importing it!) the library).
Python example:
import os

does padding in a batch of sequences affect performance how effective is the attention mask,"In Transformer models, sequences of variable lengths are typically padded to the maximum length in a batch. However, if my sequence lengths vary significantly, the batch may contain a substantial amount of padding (potentially over 50%).
I am curious about the following:
When PyTorch computes the Transformer, do padding tokens impact calculation speed negatively?
Does the presence of the attention mask allow the model to effectively skip over padding tokens, resulting in only a minimal performance impact?
Overall, how effective is the attention mask? If I have a sparse attention mask with only 10% non-zero values, does the computation effectively reduce to approximately 10%?
Thank you for your insights!
","Attention is computed on a tensor of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dimension). The compute and memory requirements scale with the size of those dimensions.
For an input of fixed size, the percent padding does not impact performance. There is some minor overhead from applying a padding mask at all (ie not having a padding mask saves you one mask fill operation), but between x% padding and y% padding you're not going to see a difference. The overall compute requirements are set by the tensor size.
With respect to batching sequences, there can be added inefficiencies for batching together sequences of wildly different length. Say you have 10 sequences of length 8 and 10 sequences of length 128. Now pad and batch those sequences into two batches. If you mix lengths evenly, you get two batches with a sequence length of 128. If you sort by length before batching, you get one batch with sequence length of 8 and another with length 128. The first case (two batches of sequence length 128) requires overall more compute compared to the second case (one batch of 8, one of 128).
That said, for a fixed input size, you aren't going to see a performance change from the percent padding. There is no way for the attention operation to ""skip over"" padding tokens. The conditional control flow required for that sort of approach doesn't work well with the way GPUs execute operations in parallel. The only effect of the padding mask is it assigns 0 attention weight to padding tokens.

The client has been initialized with a valid API key, and other calls to the API (to send text prompts) work correctly, but when I try to post a file I get a ""HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request"" error.
I have verified that the file exists and is a readable text file (the code logs the first line of the file before posting it).
The code used to initialize myFile is:
myFile = open(file_path, ""rb"");

","As stated by @codenanda, I was using the wrong file format. The current version of the OpenAI API only supports JSON files.

endpoint returning 403 after successfully executing spring boot,"I made an endpoint ""/api/chat"" that, when called, makes another request to the OpenAI API (paid for and API key valid, all that). When testing the endpoint in Postman, I first request my /auth/login endpoint to get a valid JWT login token, copy that for the Authorization header of my /api/chat call, then send it (The login auth token is 100% valid, and works perfectly for all other endpoints as well).
When the request to /api/chat is made, Postman takes around 1.5-2 seconds to process it. In the first second, my Run Console in Intellij logs the correct things to signify a request being made. For the remaining time, it then logs the exact expected response from the OpenAI API model. You would think this means everything executed fine, and it seemingly did, but then Postman (and my website if you try it there), returns 403 instead of 200 OK. This is an issue because even though I can physically see the correct response being logged in my IDE console with no errors, the 403 means I can't extract any of it for use and the website can't receive it and treats it like a completely failed request.
The ONLY way that I ""fixed"" this was making the /api/chat endpoint public in my SecurityConfig file, which made it execute the exact same way and give the same result, but returns 200 OK as expected. However, I, of course, can't leave it like this as it would mean people have public access to make calls to an endpoint that costs me for each request.
I've spent many hours trying to figure this out, including Googling, asking GPT - nothing. Verified all my JWT authentication stuff, tried something where the auth token is retained throughout, nothing worked. CORS and CSRF stuff, seemingly not that either. I can only think its something up with Spring Security because adding the endpoint to the .permitAll() list (making it public) in SecurityConfig is the only thing that made it return 200 OK as expected. This is extremely frustrating because it executes and logs exactly how and what it should, but just for some reason returns 403.
This is my first project with Spring so if its something trivial then please help out. Thanks in advance. The API key is set in my env variables, and even though I've included some error logging, no errors are ever logged, only the correct responses that I'm expecting from the AI model, with it then returning 403 as I've mentioned. I'll include the relevant bits of code, but if you think the issue is in another file or part of these files, let me know and I'll share what I can. Not that it's too important I don't think, but I'm using React for frontend.

My Postman request (not too relevant, this is not the issue):

","I tried adding the @ResponseBody but that didn't solve it. After more digging, it seems it was an issue with the Mono<ResponseEntity> return type, as that is telling Spring to process the request asynchronously and non-blocking. Converting the method to block with "".block()"" on the Mono, and making it just a normal blocking call allowed it to wait for a response from the service before proceeding. Kinda means you don't get the benefits of a reactive programming solution but at least we can progress with this now.
If you run into the same issue, try converting the call to a traditional blocking call and see if that works. Still don't really know what in Spring's reactive code is causing this but I'm glad to just move on for now.

using whisper api to generate srt transcripts,"I'm exploring the capabilities of the Whisper API and was wondering if it can be used to generate an .SRT file with transcriptions. From what I understand, this transcription to .SRT can be achieved when running the model locally using the Whisper package. Unfortunately, I don't possess the computational resources to run the model locally, so I'm leaning towards using the API directly.
Has anyone had experience with this or can provide guidance on how to approach it through the API?
The following python script can be used a starting point, but the question is about capabilities of the model itself, not specific to any programming language.
import os
import openai
openai.api_key = API_KEY
audio_file = open(""audio.mp3"", ""rb"")
transcript = openai.Audio.transcribe(""whisper-1"", audio_file)
print(transcript.text)


","A cursory look at OpenAI's docs shows that srt is a supported value for the response_format parameter on the /v1/audio/transcriptions endpoint.
With the official Python bindings you're using in your example, you should be able to pass this as a named parameter to your openai.Audio.transcribe() invocation:
transcript = openai.Audio.transcribe(""whisper-1"", audio_file, response_format=""srt"")

This is referring to the python typing module (v3.12.4) that has an additional mandatory parameter 'recursive_guard'. There are other areas of the code in pydantic where this has been fixed (recursive_gurard=set()).
Check this out --> https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/issues/1292
Within this thread, they mention that using python v3.12.3 could temporarily solve the issue in 1292, probably because this additional attribute in v3.12.4 (I am guessing here). This is not an option for me as my google alpha functions local deploy is not recognizing the --runtime=python311 and always take the latest runtime (v3.12.4).

using prompt in sql using sap bo webi 42 sp3,"I'm running a series of reports where time window called in query is rolling, and individual per report.. Some reports look 400 days back, others look 10 weeks back, while others again look at -40days/+80days... and so on - many options.
All reports are scheduled in daily or weekly runs, meaning setting prompts will require a manual reset of prompt for every instance through the scheduler. Not optimal.
I know the universe designer can design specific filters to drag into the queries using the query designer, but with so many different options, I find it a bit of an issue that the universe designer should create specific filters for these specific purposes, adding a vast number of specific filters intended for specific use to various universes.
I'm after an option where it is possible to assign a calculation to a date field, which stay fixed for the purpose of the report for every scheduled instance.
For instance, looking at invoice date from 400 days before today and onwards would look like Where DIM_TIME_INV.DAY_DAY >= sysdate -400 - This I can hardcode into the SQL of the specific report, and it will stay through the scheduler and roll 1 day for every day the report is run. But if I decide to make a change in the query elements, the SQL is screwed, and I will have to manually add the modification to the SQL again.
I found an article regarding the use of @Prompt and would ask universe designer to try and sandbox this in our version of BO.
While I'm being impatient, I try myself using following code based on example 4 from linked article.
SELECT
  @select('DIM_TIME_INV.DAY_DAY') >= sysdate -(@prompt('Invoiced, days before today:','N',[DIM_TIME_INV.DAY_DAY],mono,free))
FROM
  DIM_TIME_INV

Testing the SQL gives following error:
ORA-00936
SAP KBA 2054721
The whole idea is to have a flexible yet consistent dimension that will calculate every time the report is run, without losing the code whenever new items are added to the report.
Does anyone know of a way to use the @Prompt in SQL for SAP WEBI 4.2? - Or any other way to have 'flexible' time dimensions where it is possible to set a from-date or to-date independently or even a range, without having universe designer creating a s**t-load of filters and dump in various universes.
Thanks // C
","With regard to your example code, I think you're on the right track but your syntax has some issues:
SELECT
  @select('DIM_TIME_INV.DAY_DAY') >= sysdate -(@prompt('Invoiced, days before today:','N',[DIM_TIME_INV.DAY_DAY],mono,free))
FROM
  DIM_TIME_INV

First, both @Select and @Prompt must refer to universe objects, not columns.  The syntax for both is: class name\object name.  Assuming that the DIM_TIME_INV.DAY_DAY is associated with a universe object named Day Day in a class named Dim Time, the above code should be:
SELECT
  @select('Dim Time\Day Day') >= sysdate -(@prompt('Invoiced, days before today:','N','Dim Time\Day Day',mono,free))
FROM
  DIM_TIME_INV

Also note that the object reference in the @prompt call is delimited by single quotes, not brackets.
Next, I'm assuming that DAY_DAY is a date field.  Its reference in the @prompt call would cause the prompt to display a list of values, sourced from DAY_DAY.  But you want a numeric value from the prompt, not a date, so I would just leave that out, which will let the users enter a numeric value:
SELECT
  @select('Dim Time\Day Day') >= sysdate -(@prompt('Invoiced, days before today:','N',,mono,free))
FROM
  DIM_TIME_INV

Next, even with this corrected syntax, there will be an issue using this code as you have it.  A good way to debug @prompt issues is to view the SQL in the WebI report after you get the error -- the SQL will show the rendered result, with all functions (@select and @prompt) expanded.  For the above, you might get SQL like:
SELECT
  DIM_TIME_INV.DAY_DAY >= sysdate -(400)
FROM
  DIM_TIME_INV

This, of course, is invalid - you can't have a condition in the SELECT clause.  If this is truly intended to be a condition (which I think it is, based on your objective), then it should be a predefined condition rather than a dimension.
With that said, I think you're on the right track for what you want to do.  With the above corrections, you would have a predefined condition that you could drop into reports, which would enable the users to select the starting period (by number of days ago) for the report.  You could create additional prompts with different logic, ex:
@select('Dim Time\Day Day') >= sysdate -(@prompt('Invoiced, weeks before today:','N',,mono,free) * 7)

or
@select('Dim Time\Day Day') 
BETWEEN sysdate - @prompt('Starting days ago:','N',,mono,free)
    AND sysdate - @prompt('Ending days ago:','N',,mono,free)

openai assistants api is the whole thread with all the past messages sent to the api every time i add a new message to the thread,"While I was using the Chat Completions API, I learned that you need to include the trail of the questions from the user and answers from the OpenAI API (including the system messages) when asking a new question if you want the Chat Completions API to be able to have the chat history included.
With the Assistants API, you don't need to do that, and it remembers the chat history.
My question is, what happens to token consumption in the case of the Assistants API? Would all the past messages be included in the token consumption?
","Token consumption in the Assistants API can be very, very high if you use the same thread for a long time because the thread is storing message history and passing the whole thread to the API every time you ask a new question using the existing thread.
After some time, a single message you ask the Assistants API can cost a lot, even if the message is short. See the past discussion:

/ ... /
The message contains around 1000 tokens, checked via
https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer
/ ... /
This code takes around 250,000 tokens to complete. The image shows
today's token usage for three requests.


What the developer didn't understand is that your recent message might contain 1,000 tokens, but you also need to keep in mind that hundreds of messages that were either asked by you or answered by the assistant in the past were also sent to the Assistants API.
There is, however, a limit of 100,000 messages per thread. As stated in the official OpenAI documentation:

The contents of the messages your users or applications create are
added as Message objects to the Thread. Messages can contain both text
and files. There is a limit of 100,000 Messages per Thread and we
smartly truncate any context that does not fit into the model's
context window.

","The actual issue is in your Seq2SeqTrainingArguments which is leading the error in your data_collator().
Reason: The .trainer() is by default removing any unknown columns (not present in the model's forward method) from your data when you are providing a custom data_collator(). As a result even though each sample in your train_dataset has all the keys, when you send that to data_collator(), the .trainer() automatically removes the unknown columns.
Solution: You need to include an argument in your training arguments like the following:
training_args = Seq2SeqTrainingArguments(
predict_with_generate=True,
remove_unused_columns=False, 
...)

The remove_unused_columns=False, would prevent the default behaviour and you'd get the entire data in data_collator(). This issue would be useful for further reference.

Working Code
When using the following simplified code, I am able to get a response from the chatbox:
import { openai } from ""@ai-sdk/openai"";
import { streamText } from ""ai"";
import { NextResponse } from ""next/server"";

export const runtime = ""edge"";

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  try {
    const { messages } = await req.json();
    const response = await streamText({
      model: openai(""gpt-4o-mini""),
      messages,
    });
    return response.toDataStreamResponse();
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: ""Internal Server Error"" },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
}


This should provide a clear context for the issue and indicate that the problem might be related to the configuration or dependencies rather than the core functionality of fetching chat responses.
Steps to Reproduce

Run the application with the provided route.ts and ChatComponent.tsx code.
Observe the error when attempting to start or compile the project.

I attempted to implement a chat functionality in my Next.js application using the streamText function from the ai package and the openai model. Specifically, I used the following code to handle POST requests and fetch chat responses:
import { openai } from ""@ai-sdk/openai"";
import { streamText } from ""ai"";
import { NextResponse } from ""next/server"";

export const runtime = ""edge"";

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  try {
    const { messages } = await req.json();
    const response = await streamText({
      model: openai(""gpt-4o-mini""),
      messages,
    });
    return response.toDataStreamResponse();
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: ""Internal Server Error"" },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
}

I expected this implementation to correctly process incoming messages and return a valid response from the chatbox.
What actually resulted?
Although the code runs without errors and returns a response in a simplified setup, I encountered issues with the more complex implementation, which includes additional logic such as database interactions and context handling. In those cases, I am receiving a 500 Internal Server Error and the response is not as expected. The simplified code works as intended and provides the expected chat responses.

sweetalert prompt with two input fields,"Currently working on a personal project. I want the user to click a button and a SweetAlert prompt would be presented for the user to verify their credential. However, the code I see on the SweetAlert website only allows one input field. Here is the code I have:

  text: ""Test"",

using a single api key or generating temporary keys for each user,"I'm building a Flutter app that requires the OpenAI GPT3 API, and I'm not sure how to implement it. Currently, I'm using a single API key that's stored in a .env file and accessed via the flutter_dotenv package. I'm wondering whether it's best to use this one API key for all users of the app, or whether I should implement an API gateway and generate temporary API keys for each user.
While I don't anticipate reaching the request limit for my single API key after I release the app, I'm uncertain about the best approach. What are the potential downsides to using a single API key for all users, and what are the benefits of generating temporary keys for each user? Would an API gateway be necessary for my use case?
","Are you concerned about security or people abusing your tool and hurting your OpenAI API limits?
Security
If you are concerned about security, keep your API key secret, and make sure it does not leak to any frontend or public repo.
You can even use secret manager solutions like Doppler, AWS Secret Manager, or 1password for developers.
Cost/API limits
You may want reduce the risk of someone harming your system and potentially costing you thousands of dollars by making a lot of API requests.
One solution is to track on your side how many calls are made over a period of time per user.
Ex: one user can generate 15 completions per period of 24 hours.
If you offer a paying plan for your service, this is an incentive for people to upgrade.
To fight abuse, OpenAI has also implemented End-user Ids.
You can add a user parameter to your API requests. It will identify which user is responsible for which API call, and eventually, you can shut it down.
Here you can read more in the doc.

js dowhile loop infinitely loops over function when timeout is set,"i need a prompt window to let the user type in a number.
When setting the function (code below) once, everything works but this promt window should accure until a variable with an integer (starting from 200) reaches 0, so i thought a do while loop would do the trick. 
But when setting the do while loop the prompt window shows up immediately after typing in a number and does not change anything. 
I also changed the code until the loop got infinite and my brwoser crashed.
I know that the condition in the do while loop is always true (machineFuel > 0 && height > 0) because the variables machineFuel and height are greater than 0 but i dont know how to set it up correctly.
Here the relevant code (shortened)

var machineFuel = 200;
var height = 500;


setTimeout(round, 2000);

function round() {
    do {
       playerInput = input();
    } while (machineFuel > 0 && height > 0);
    calculate();
}

function input(fuel) {
    fuel = parseInt(prompt(""Fuel"", ""A number from 0-200""));
    return fuel;
}

function calculate() {
    machineFuel = machineFuel - playerInput;
}



","Move calculate after input() otherwise your machineFuel won't be updated and while will run forever.
Also the OP commented he needs the timeout after each prompt. So we remove while and call setTimeout() again:


var machineFuel = 200;
var height = 500;


setTimeout(round, 2000);

function round() {
   playerInput = input();
   calculate();
   machineFuel > 0 && height > 0 && setTimeout(round, 2000);
}

function input(fuel) {
    fuel = parseInt(prompt(""Fuel"", ""A number from 0-200""));
    return fuel;
}

function calculate() {
    machineFuel = machineFuel - playerInput;
}



The OP asked for a while option. For that we need to wrap setTimeout to a promise:


var machineFuel = 200;
var height = 500;

round();

async function round() {

  do {
    
   await delay(2000);
    
   playerInput = input();
   calculate();
  
  } while (machineFuel > 0 && height > 0);

}

function delay(delay) {
    return new Promise(function(resolve){
      setTimeout(resolve, delay);
    });
}

function input(fuel) {
    fuel = parseInt(prompt(""Fuel"", ""A number from 0-200""));
    return fuel;
}

how to load a quantized finetuned llama 38b model in vllm for faster inference,"I am working on deploying a quantized fine-tuned LLaMA 3-8B model and I aim to use vLLM  to achieve faster inference. I am currently using the following Python code to load the model:

what is the difference between openai and chatopenai in langchain,"I read the LangChain Quickstart.
There is a demo inside:
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

llm = OpenAI()
chat_model = ChatOpenAI()

llm.predict(""hi!"")
>>> ""Hi""

chat_model.predict(""hi!"")
>>> ""Hi""

I searched the rest of the document and also online, but didn't find any info for the difference between OpenAI and ChatOpenAI.
Based on from langchain.llms import OpenAI, OpenAI is a large language model (LLM) which is also chat related.
So is OpenAI more general-purpose, while ChatOpenAI more chat focused?
What is the difference between OpenAI class and ChatOpenAI class in LangChain? Could someone clarify?
","TL;DR
Based on my research,

OpenAI class includes more generic machine learning task attributes such as frequency_penalty, presence_penalty, logit_bias, allowed_special, disallowed_special, best_of.

ChatOpenAI class provides more chat-related methods, such as completion_with_retry, get_num_tokens_from_messages to make it more user-friendly when build chatbot related applications.



Class Inheritance
Upon reviewing the source code, here's what I've discovered.
Listed below are the class inheritances for both the OpenAI and ChatOpenAI classes, along with their respective class attributes and methods.
OpenAI
OpenAI ← BaseOpenAI ← BaseLLM ← BaseLanguageModel

ChatOpenAI
ChatOpenAI ← BaseChatModel ← BaseLanguageModel

Comparison
Let's begin our comparison, moving from the fourth column to the first column.
Fourth Column
Both classes ultimately inherit from the base class BaseLanguageModel.
Third Column
BaseLLM and BaseChatModel are very similar with slightly difference:

For OpenAI's BaseLLM, it includes additional methods:

batch(self, inputs, config=None, max_concurrency=None, **kwargs)
abatch (self, inputs, config=None, max_concurrency=None,**kwargs)


For ChatOpenAI's BaseChatModel, it includes an extra method:

_combine_llm_outputs(self, llm_outputs)



Second Column
The second column contains the BaseOpenAI class, which primarily exists due to the presence of higher-level classes OpenAI and AzureOpenAI. However, they all share the same class attributes and methods.
First Column
At the top-level class (first column):

OpenAI class includes more generic machine learning task attributes such as frequency_penalty, presence_penalty, logit_bias, allowed_special, disallowed_special, best_of.

ChatOpenAI class provides more chat-related methods, such as completion_with_retry, get_num_tokens_from_messages to make it more user-friendly when build chatbot related applications.

how to make sense of the output of the reward model how do we know what string it is preferring,"In the process of doing RLHF I made a reward model using a dataset of chosen and rejected string pairs. It is very similar to the example that's there in the official TRL library - Reward Modeling
I used LLaMA 2 7b model (tried both the chat and non-chat versions - the behavior is the same).
Now what I would like to do is to actually pass an input and see the output of the Reward model. However I can’t seem to make any sense of what the reward model outputs.
For example: I tried to make the input as follows -
chosen = ""This is the chosen text.""
rejected = ""This is the rejected text.""
test = {""chosen"": chosen, ""rejected"": rejected}

Then I try -
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
base_model_id = ""./llama2models/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf""
model_id = ""./reward_models/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf_rm_inference/checkpoint-500""

model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
    model_id,
    # num_labels=1, #gives an error since the model always outputs a tensor of [2, 4096]
)

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(base_model_id)
rewards_chosen = model(
            **tokenizer(chosen, return_tensors='pt')
        ).logits
print('reward chosen is ', rewards_chosen)

rewards_rejected = model(
           **tokenizer(rejected, return_tensors='pt')
        ).logits

print('reward rejected is ', rewards_rejected)
loss = -nn.functional.logsigmoid(rewards_chosen - rewards_rejected).mean()
print(loss)

And the output looks something like this -
reward chosen is  tensor([[ 2.1758, -8.8359]], dtype=torch.float16)
reward rejected is  tensor([[ 1.0908, -2.2168]], dtype=torch.float16)
tensor(0.0044)

Printing loss wasn’t helpful. I mean I do not see any trend (for example positive loss turning negative) even if I switch rewards_chosen and rewards_rejected in the formula.
Also the outputs did not yield any insights. I do not understand how to make sense of rewards_chosen and rewards_rejected. Why are they a tensor with two elements instead of one?
I tried rewards_chosen > rewards_rejected but that is also not helpful since it outputs tensor([[ True, False]])
When I try some public reward model (its just a few megabytes since its just the adapter - https://huggingface.co/vincentmin/llama-2-13b-reward-oasst1) then I get outputs that make more sense since its outputs a single element tensor -
Code -
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

from peft import PeftModel, PeftConfig
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

peft_model_id = ""./llama-2-13b-reward-oasst1""
base_model_id = ""/cluster/work/lawecon/Work/raj/llama2models/13b-chat-hf""
config = PeftConfig.from_pretrained(peft_model_id)
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
    base_model_id,
    num_labels=1,
    # torch_dtype=torch.float16,
)
model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(model, peft_model_id)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(base_model_id)
chosen = ""prompter: What is your purpose? assistant: My purpose is to assist you.""
rejected = ""prompter: What is your purpose? assistant: I do not understand you.""
test = {""chosen"": chosen, ""rejected"": rejected}

model.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
    rewards_chosen = model(
                **tokenizer(chosen, return_tensors='pt')
            ).logits
    print('reward chosen is ', rewards_chosen)

    rewards_rejected = model(
               **tokenizer(rejected, return_tensors='pt')
            ).logits

    print('reward rejected is ', rewards_rejected)
    loss = -nn.functional.logsigmoid(rewards_chosen - rewards_rejected).mean()
    print(loss)

Output -
reward chosen is  tensor([[0.6876]])
reward rejected is  tensor([[-0.9243]])
tensor(0.1819)

This output makes more sense to me. But why do I get the outputs that have two values with my reward model?
","I've been facing the exact same issue myself, after following the same example on the TRL library! I think there's a mistake in that example; reward models should output single-element tensors as you suggest, rather than two-element tensors.
I believe that setting num_labels=1 when calling AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained is the solution here. This instantiates a model with a single-element output.
I can see that you've commented this out in your example, saying that it ""gives an error since the model always outputs a tensor of [2, 4096]"". I get no such error, so I'm not sure what's going on for you there.

A formatted string literal or f-string is a string literal that is prefixed with 'f' or 'F'. These strings may contain replacement fields, which are expressions delimited by curly braces {}. While other string literals always have a constant value, formatted strings are really expressions evaluated at run time.

","Option 1: OpenAI API key not set as an environment variable
Change this...
openai.api_key = os.getenv('sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx')
...to this.
openai.api_key = 'sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'

Option 2: OpenAI API key set as an environment variable (recommended)
There are two ways to set the OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

using an .env file (easier, but don't forget to create a .gitignore file) or
using Windows Environment Variables.

Way 1: Using an .env file
Change this...
openai.api_key = os.getenv('sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx')
...to this...
openai.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
Also, don't forget to use the python-dotenv package. Your final Python file should look as follows:
# main.py

import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from openai import OpenAI

# Load environment variables from the .env file
load_dotenv()

# Initialize OpenAI client with the API key from environment variables
client = OpenAI(
    api_key=os.getenv(""OPENAI_API_KEY""),
)

It's crucial that you create a .gitignore file not to push the .env file to your GitHub/GitLab and leak your OpenAI API key!
# .gitignore

.env

Way 2: Using Windows Environment Variables (source)
STEP 1: Open System properties and select Advanced system settings

STEP 2: Select Environment Variables

STEP 3: Select New
STEP 4: Add your name/key value pair
Variable name: OPENAI_API_KEY

Variable value: sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

STEP 5: Restart your computer (IMPORTANT!)
Your final Python file should look as follows:
# main.py

import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize OpenAI client
# It will automatically use your OpenAI API key set via Windows Environment Variables
client = OpenAI()

","A warm-up is in general an increase of the learning rate. It starts at 0 and then increases linearly over 1(here) step to the specified learning rate of 1.25e-5.
Afterwards by default a linear (in other cases a cosine) learning-rate scheduler decays your learning-rate.
To disable the decay add lr_scheduler_type='constant'.
If I recall correctly, this also disables the warmup.

continual pretraining vs finetuning a language model with mlm,"I have some custom data I want to use to further pre-train the BERT model. I’ve tried the two following approaches so far:

Starting with a pre-trained BERT checkpoint and continuing the pre-training with Masked Language Modeling (MLM) + Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) heads (e.g. using BertForPreTraining model)
Starting with a pre-trained BERT model with the MLM objective (e.g. using the BertForMaskedLM model assuming we don’t need NSP for the pretraining part.)

But I’m still confused that if using either BertForPreTraining or BertForMaskedLM actually does the continual pre-training on BERT or these are just two models for fine-tuning that use MLM+NSP and MLM for fine-tuning BERT, respectively. Is there even any difference between fine-tuning BERT with MLM+NSP or continually pre-train it using these two heads or this is something we need to test?
I've reviewed similar questions such as this one but still, I want to make sure that whether technically there's a difference between continual pre-training a model from an initial checkpoint and fine-tuning it using the same objective/head.
","The answer is a mere difference in the terminology used. When the model is trained on a large generic corpus, it is called 'pre-training'. When it is adapted to a particular task or dataset it is called as 'fine-tuning'.
Technically speaking, in either cases ('pre-training' or 'fine-tuning'), there are updates to the model weights.
For example, usually, you can just take the pre-trained model and then fine-tune it for a specific task (such as classification, question-answering, etc.). However, if you find that the target dataset is from a specific domain, and you have a few unlabled data that might help the model to adapt to the particular domain, then you can do a MLM or MLM+NSP 'fine-tuning' (unsupervised learning) (some researchers do call this as 'pre-training' especially when a huge corpus is used to train the model), followed by using the target corpus with target task fine-tuning.

Thank you in advance for your help!
","You can't fine-tune a fp16/uint8 model with AMP. AMP uses fp32 parameters. The params are autocast to fp16 for the forward pass, but AMP expects the master set of parameters to be FP32.
You also shouldn't fine-tune a quantized model in the first place. The quantization causes all sorts of numerical issues and instability during training.
What you are supposed to do is keep the quantized model static and train an adapter on top of the quantized model. You can find more details here

python  bash prompt how to print width calculation wrappers,"I wrote a Python script to replace ""powerline"" as a terminal prompt solution for myself here: https://github.com/diogobaeder/dotfiles/blob/master/.bash_prompt.py
Then all I do is to define the prompt from the output of that script:
# in my ~/.bashrc
export PS1=""\$(python ~/.bash_prompt.py)""

The script itself works fine, I get the command prompt I want; However, since there's no wrapping for the styles I put there, the terminal (doesn't matter which GUI terminal program I use) doesn't calculate the prompt width correctly, and as I type characters after the prompt it ends up not wrapping them to a new line at first, overwriting the prompt completely.
Now, I know that when stylizing my bash prompt I need to escape style codes with \[ and \] so that bash takes into consideration that they're escape sequences and calculates the width correctly. However, if I put them as wrappers for my styles in my Python script (see esc_start and esc_end), I can't get them to be properly evaluated by bash as ""calculation escape sequences"", instead I get literal square brackets printed. If I then escape in Python the backslashes too (\\[ and \\]), then I get unescaped literals outputted (\[ and \]). Bash seems to completely ignore them as escape sequences for calculating the prompt width.
If, however, I remove the backslash in my PS1 command ($(python ~/.bash_prompt.py) instead of \$(python ~/.bash_prompt.py)), then putting \[ and \] as escape sequences in my Python script (as esc_start and esc_end), then bash considers them as proper escapes and ends up wrapping lines as expected (i.e., when I go past the right border it wraps the line as expected). The problem with this, however, is that removing this backslash from my PS1 definition in .bashrc makes the script run only once per terminal session, and not for each prompt line - so, for example, if I'm in a Git working tree and I change from one branch to another, it doesn't show the new branch as soon as the command finishes, instead it shows the old branch.
Let me give some examples of what I mean, that you can try in your own .bashrc without needing my Python script:
PS1=""\[\033[31m\]\u@\h\[\033[0m\]$ "" # This wraps lines correctly
PS1=""\033[31m\u@\h\033[0m$ "" # This makes the line overwrite the prompt

So, any ideas of how to cope with bash and make it understand the \[ and \] sequences correctly when printed by the Python script, while still keeping the script running for each command prompt? Or, if this is a limitation in bash, is there another way to force it to wrap the line when it reaches the right border of the terminal window?
Thanks!

","Bash first interprets the escape sequences in $PS1 and only afterwards handles command substitution, etc.

Bash allows these prompt strings to be customized by inserting a number of backslash-escaped special characters that are decoded as follows [...]
  After the string is decoded, it  is  expanded  via  parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal [...]

 --Bash Reference Manual: Controlling the Prompt
This means that any special sequences printed by your command will not be interpreted as colors, etc.  The solution is to use $PROMPT_COMMAND to change the value of $PS1, like:

shortened path relative to git repository in terminal prompt with zsh,"GOAL
I'm trying to create a shortened path for my terminal prompt that is relative to the repository in which I'm in. Similar to what I already have for my root & home directory shown below.
The last directory shown in the following terminal prompts' paths is always the current working directory.
root:
/ %
/rootDir %
/rootDir/dir1/dir2 %
/rootDir/.../dir2/dir3 %
/rootDir/.../dir3/dir4 %

home:
~ %
~/dir1/dir2 %
~/.../dir2/dir3 %
~/.../dir3/dir4 %

And I'm trying to figure a way to have it work the same way when I'm in a repository. Where the repository is the ""root"" instead of the actual root or home being the ""root"" of the path.
repository:
|repo %
|repo/dir1/dir2 %
|repo/.../dir2/dir3 %
|repo/.../dir3/dir4 %

WHAT I'VE DONE
my .zshrc code:
autoload -Uz vcs_info
zstyle ':vcs_info:git:*' formats '|%r'
zstyle ':vcs_info:git:*' check-for-changes true

setopt PROMPT_SUBST

precmd()
{
    vcs_info
    if [ -d .git ];
    then
        PROMPT='${vcs_info_msg_0_}'
    elif $(git rev-parse > /dev/null 2>&1);
    then
        PROMPT='${vcs_info_msg_0_}/%c'
    else
        PROMPT='%(4~|%-1~/.../%2~|%3~)'
    fi

    PROMPT+=' %# '
}

The solution for the path when in the root or home directory is pretty simple:
PROMPT='%(4~|%-1~/.../%2~|%3~)'

This checks the length of the path from the working directory to the which ever is the closest, root or home and displays one of two different paths depending on how many directories long the relative path is.
I couldn't figure out a way to modify this for the repository however. As I have it now it uses an if..else which checks whether my working directory is the ""root"" of the repo or if I'm further inside of the repo. And use these to either display just the name of the repo or the name and the current working directory. To make it work like with the root & home directories however I would need to have the current length between the repo and working directory or some other simpler solution which I might have missed.
","Finally got around to this again. I ended up working out a solution that does the intended:
autoload -Uz vcs_info
zstyle ':vcs_info:git:*' formats '|%r'
zstyle ':vcs_info:git:*' check-for-changes true

setopt PROMPT_SUBST

precmd()
{
    vcs_info

# in git repo
    if [[ -n $(git rev-parse --git-dir 2> /dev/null) ]]; then

    # in root of git repo
        if [ -d .git ];
        then
            PROMPT='${vcs_info_msg_0_}'

    # in first subfolder of git repo
        elif [ -d ../.git ];
        then
            PROMPT='${vcs_info_msg_0_}/%c'

    # in second subfolder of git repo
        elif [ -d ../../.git ];
        then
            PROMPT='${vcs_info_msg_0_}/%2c'

    # in deeper subfolder of git repo
        else
            PROMPT='${vcs_info_msg_0_}/.../%2c'
        fi

# not in git repo
    else
        PROMPT='%(4~|%-1~/.../%2~|%3~)'
    fi

    PROMPT+=' %# '
}

Not the most elegant of hacks but not being very familiar with the syntax this is what I came up with.
Now the function checks the working directory's relative position to the .git file that is found at the root of every git repository. To reduce the amount of checks done by the function it firstly has an if statement that checks whether the current directory is anywhere inside of a git repository. If not, the previous solution from the original post for the home and root paths is used instead.

how do i run a js file from another js file,"I am building a game inside the console, I'm using an NPM package called ""prompts"", and it asks from the user for the game, ""What OS do you want to run?"" and returns as JSON.

if(Bootup == ""StartOS1"") {
 // The code to run another JS file here.
}

But I don't know what to put.
I've tried to do this with a NPM package called shelljs, which executes stuff in the shell:

const shell = require('shelljs')

if(Bootup == ""StartOS1"") {
  shell.exec('node OS1.js')
}

What this did was make my shell stuck on a blank line forever, and I had to restart it. This shows an example of what I'm trying to do.
","shell.exec('node OS1.js') is a synchronous function that will block your program. For instance, if your js file is waiting on an event, it might block your functions indefinitely. Try child_process's exec() method. This should help:
const { exec } = require('child_process');

exec('node OS1.js', (e, stdout, stde) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(`exec error: ${e}`);
    return;
  }
  console.log(`stdout: ${stdout}`);
  console.error(`stderr: ${stde}`);
});

There are also a couple of other methods you can use, but this one reads the js file as a string then executes it via the other synchronous eval function. Though I heard it's not the best practice when it comes to security.
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('./node OS1.js', 'utf8', function(e, file) {
  if (e) {
    console.error(e);
    return;
  }
  eval(file);

bash already knows how to handle its own escape sequences \u, \h, and \W. The ANSI escape sequences only have special meaning to the terminal.
That is, \u et al are expanded before bash tries to determine how many characters are in the prompt. For all it knows, \e, [, 0, ;, 3, 4, and m will all be displayed literally as single characters.

open file password prompt while closing,"I have two separated workbooks with macroces: Book1 with Macro1 and Book2 with Macro2.
Macro1 is simple code to:

hidely open Book2 (has an open password: 1111);
write ""test"" in A1 Active Sheet of Book2;
run Macro2 from Book2, which is simple MsgBox ""Hello! I am an msgbox
from Book2"";
close Book2 with saving.

Sub Macro1()
Application.ScreenUpdating = False
Application.EnableEvents = False
Application.DisplayAlerts = False

Dim myWb As Workbook
Set myWb = Workbooks.Open(ThisWorkbook.Path & ""/"" & ""Book2.xlsb"", True, False, , ""1111"")
myWb.Unprotect (""1111"")

myWb.Close savechanges:=True


Application.DisplayAlerts = True
Application.ScreenUpdating = True
Application.EnableEvents = True
End Sub

Sub Macro2()
MsgBox ""Hello! I am an msgbox from Book2""
End Sub

I emphasize that everything should be done secretly and the user should not see neither Book2 nor any flashes, etc.
But when code comes to the saving step a window pops up on the screen, which, by the way, can be ignored and the code will continue to run/execute but anyway it's a PROBLEM I want get rid of:
password pop-up window
What I noticed:

If I remove the opening password from book2, the saving will be successfull and without pop-up dialogs. But I need Book2 opening protected.
I tried to modify code, but results are not unsatisfactory due to
screen blinking, screenshots below:
OK
V1-NOK
V2-NOK

V1: myWb.IsAddin = True is deleted/commented
Application.Run ""'Book2.xlsb'!Macro2""

V2: ON/OFF IsAddin = True before/after Macro2 executing
myWb.IsAddin = True
Application.Run ""'Book2.xlsb'!Macro2""
myWb.IsAddin = False
myWb.Close savechanges:=True

","Please, try the next way. It will open the workbook in a new session, will write in its first sheet and run the macro. But a macro sending a message from a non visible session/window is not the best idea. In order to see the message, please move the cursor over the Excel workbooks icons on taskbar, select the MsgBox window and press OK. A better idea would be do avoid sending messages. The code should run as you need:
Sub HiddenWBOpenRunMacro()
  Dim newEx As Excel.Application, myWb As Workbook
  
  Set newEx = CreateObject(""Excel.Application"")
  'Open the workbook in the newly created session:
  Set myWb = newEx.Workbooks.Open(ThisWorkbook.Path & ""/"" & ""Book2.xlsb"", , , , ""1111"")

  myWb.Sheets(1).cells(1, 1).Value = ""Test""  'write in its first sheet
  myWb.Application.Run ""'Book2.xlsb'!Macro2"" 'run the macro

  myWb.Close True                            'close the workbook, saving it
  newEx.Quit                                 'quit the session

How are the layers re-initialized through the from_config function? Is it using Xaiver/He initialization or just random initialization?
","MistralConfig has a default parameter initializer_range which is set to 0.02 and described as The standard deviation of the truncated_normal_initializer for initializing all weight matrices, so one can assume they use a truncated normal distribution with a standard deviation of 0.02.
If you plot the actual model weights distribution and what a truncated normal distribution with standard deviation of 0.02 looks like, it seems like a fit to me:
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import truncnorm
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoConfig

# histogram of actual weights distribution
c = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(""mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.3"")
m2 = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_config(c)
weights = m2.model.layers[0].mlp.down_proj.state_dict()['weight'].ravel()
plt.hist(weights, bins=np.linspace(-0.1, 0.1, 100), histtype='step', density=True, label='model weights')

# what a truncated normal distribution with mean 0 and std 0.02 is supposed to look like
lower = -0.1
upper = 0.1
mean = 0
std = 0.02
a, b = (lower - mean) / std, (upper - mean) / std
x = np.linspace(lower, upper, 1000)
plt.plot(x, truncnorm.pdf(x, a, b, loc=mean, scale=std), label='expected')

is there a module or something similar for interactive prompts in powershell,"Is there something we can use in PowerShell to ask users to select one item from an array of items? For example, I like how Inquirer.js can do it. 

I have also seen PoshGui, but it seems too much work to create just a simple prompt.
The reason we want something similar is that we need to provide deployment scripts for our clients and make deployment guides as easy as possible. Asking users to select one item on a screen is much better than asking them to insert some guid to a config file.
Do you have any suggestions for user prompts for arrays?

","According to the information given in your post, you have two requirements:

the transformers package you are trying to use requires a PyTorch version of >= 1.13.0

the maximum CUDA version supported by your GPU is 11.4, so the CUDA toolkit  installed via PyTorch must be <= 11.4


That CUDA version was decommissioned on the release of PyTorch 1.13, see release notes. So a viable solution for you would be to see whether you can update your CUDA driver to 11.6 or 11.7. With that version, you will be able to install PyTorch 1.13 with the appropriate CUDA toolkit.

how to develop a generalized rag pipeline for text images and structured data,"I'm trying to find a general solution for RAG to solve problems involving both text, images, chart, tables,.., they are in many different formats such as .docx, .xlsx, .pdf.
The requirement for the answer:

Some answers are just images
Some answers only contain text and need to be absolutely accurate because it relates to a process,...
On the other hand, the answers may not need to be absolutely accurate but should still ensure logical consistency; this is something I am already working on

The features of the documents:

Some documents in DOCX and Excel formats contain only text; this is the simplest form. My task is to determine the embedding model and LLM, in addition to selecting hyperparameters such as chunk size, chunk overlap, etc., and experimenting to find the appropriate values
If the documents have more complex content, such as DOCX files containing text and images, or PDF files containing text, images, charts, tables, etc., I haven't found a general solution to handle them yet.

what method and tool for regression analysis for a multimodal distribution in r,"I have a set of variables X1 and X2 and Y with relationship plot as shown below. X2 values are used for color coding.
X1, X2, and X3 are integer variables.

The observed pattern is multimodal.
What is the best way to predict Y based on X1 and X2?
Can we use non-linear or hurdle models for this?
Also what are the tools available to achieve this in R?
","Generally speaking, there is no need to worry about the distribution of the response. Although you are showing a bivariate plot, it is possible that the multi-modality is explained by X2 (or other, missing variables)
It is the distribution of the model residuals that matters (if it matters at all).
If the residuals are non-normal, then certain inferences may be invalid, although this may not be a problem at all if the model is used for prediction.
If you really do have a curvilinear association then you could consider:

transformations
non-linear terms
splines
generalised additive models (GAMs)
non-linear models

Of course, if the underlying problem is that you have missing explanatory variables, then some of these approaches may lead to an overfitted model.

speeding up load time of llms,"I am currently only able to play around with a V100 on GCP. I understand that I can load a LLM in 4bit quantization as shown below. However, (assuming due to the quantization) it is taking up to 10 minutes to load this model.
Is there a way to speed up this loading process?

I see that there is GGUF file format which may help in this regard (although I am not sure why/ how).
Would doing torch.compile somehow help me load the model next time in a fast manner. My hypothesis being that when compiled, I can save the resulting model in a binary format that can load faster?
Should I be baking the loaded model into the docker image somehow to speed this up? The downside being due to cuda the docker image is already at 4GB.

calculation of pricing of tokens in openai calls,"I'm trying to price the tokens used in a call to OPENAI. I have a txt file with plain text that was uploaded to Qdrant. When I ask the following question:
Who is Michael Jordan?
and use the get_openai_callback function to track the number of tokens and the price of the operation, one of the keys of information in the output doesn't make sense to me.
Tokens Used: 85
    Prompt Tokens: 68
    Completion Tokens: 17
Successful Requests: 1
Total Cost (USD): $0.00013600000000000003

Why does the Prompt Tokens value differ from the input value? The amount of tokens in the input text (which is what I understand as Prompt Token) is:
query = 'Who is Michael Jordan'

encoding = tiktoken.encoding_for_model('gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct')
print(f""Tokens: {len(encoding.encode(query))}"")

4

, but the output in the response is like 68. I considered the idea that Prompt Tokens were the sum of the base tokens (txt file) added to the question tokens, but the math doesn't fit.
Number of tokens in the txt file: 17
Arquivo txt: 'Michael Jeffrey Jordan is an American businessman and former basketball player who played as a shooting guard'
query + file_token: 21 (4+17)
Could anyone help me understand the pricing calculation?
I tried to search OPENAI's own documentation, github and other forums, but I don't think it's easy to find information or that it's open to the public. I want to understand if I'm missing something or if it's a calculation that users don't have access to.
UPDATE
For any future questions from other users:
import langchain 
langchain.debug = True

Run the get_openai_callback() function and see the entire log appear on the screen. The value of the ""prompts"" key is a list containing a string that is the instruction on how the response should be given. The number of tokens for this prompt is the value that appears in the Prompt Tokens.
","Prompt Tokens includes your question and any context provided, plus additional system messages and formatting added by the API. While Completion Tokens generated in the response.
In your example:
Visible Query: Who is Michael Jordan? (4 tokens)
Text from File: Michael Jeffrey Jordan is an American businessman and former basketball player who played as a shooting guard (17 tokens)
Expected: 4+17=21
4+17=21 tokens.
However, you see 68 prompt tokens because the API adds tokens for roles, instructions, and other metadata.To understand the exact token count, you can log the full request payload or use OpenAI's token counting tools.
This extra context explains why the prompt token count is higher than expected.

huggingface model loaded from the disk generates gibberish,"I trained a LongT5 model using Huggingface's tooling.
When I use the trained model directly after training the inference works as expected, I get good quality output, as expected from the training metrics. However if I save the model and load it from the disk, the output is gibberish. I can't figure out why.
Code producing good output:
text = dataset['test'][0]['from']
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors=""pt"").input_ids
inputs = inputs.to('cuda:0')

model.eval()

with torch.no_grad():
    model.to('cuda:0')
    model.generation_config = generation_config
    outputs = model.generate(inputs)

translation = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

# Prints correct output
print(translation)

How I save the model:
trainer.save_model(os.path.join(model_output_dir, ""final""))
tokenizer.save_pretrained(os.path.join(model_output_dir, ""final""))

How I load the model:
model = LongT5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(os.path.join(model_output_dir, ""final""))
model.to('cuda:0')
model.generation_config = generation_config

outputs = model.generate(inputs)

translation = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

# Prints random garbage, like:
# pamper verre195188 albums188 albums188188 albums188 albums188 albums188 albums; unterschiedlich188 albums188 albums188 albums ...

print(translation)

In both cases, the tokenizer is the instance that already exists in memory during the training, but it doesn't make a difference whether I load it from the disk or not -- same result.
The generation_config variable looks like this and it's also set in the training arguments:
generation_config = GenerationConfig.from_model_config(model.config)
generation_config._from_model_config = False
generation_config.max_new_tokens = 512

It makes no difference whether it's set in the inference code or not, I still get gibberish.
","So, it turns out some strange bug in the current stable version of safetensors. It doesn't save the encoder.embed_tokens.weight and decoder.embed_tokens.weight state, so when the model is loaded again, these layers are initialized with random numbers.
There are two workarounds:

Use the latest version of safetensors where this seems to be fixed:

!pip install -U git+https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors.git


Don't use safetensors to save your model at all. You can set save_safetensors=False in the training arguments, so that HF will use pickle to save your model instead of safetensors.

","The way you should think about using llm model is that you have to pass it information systematically.
Since you are using a publicly available model they come with things like weights, cfg etc... so you don't need to declare yours.
All you need do is to start by declaring the file-paths of your model(i.e where you downloaded it).
Also there is tokenism (tokens are simply vectors which models understand they usually map it with the given words you ask it).
If the output is not the desired, You can use different tokenizers
You can look up the process of using different tokens or tokenizers such as BERT, All-net etc here is a link to a blog

what is quotlanguage modeling headquot in bertformaskedlm,"I have recently read about BERT and want to use BertForMaskedLM for fill_mask task. I know about BERT architecture. Also, as far as I know, BertForMaskedLM is built from BERT with a language modeling head on top, but I have no idea about what language modeling head means here. Can anyone give me a brief explanation.
","The BertForMaskedLM, as you have understood correctly uses a Language Modeling(LM) head .
Generally, as well as in this case, LM head is a linear layer having input dimension of hidden state (for BERT-base it will be 768) and output dimension of vocabulary size. Thus, it maps to hidden state output of BERT model to a specific token in the vocabulary. The loss is calculated based on the scores obtained of a given token with respect to the target token.

bert model splits words by its own,"I am tokenizing the input words using bert model.
The code is :
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-multilingual-cased',do_lower_case = False)
model = BertModel.from_pretrained(""bert-base-multilingual-cased"", add_pooling_layer=False, output_hidden_states=True, output_attentions=True)

marked_text =  text + "" [SEP]""
    tokenized_text = tokenizer.tokenize(marked_text)
    indexed_tokens = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(tokenized_text)
    print(tokenized_text)
    print(indexed_tokens)

The model I used is from HuggingFace.
My goal is to print the embedded vectors of all words Bert model has, so I searched and found that this model has 119296 tokens available.
I don't know this number of the tokens is reason, but the model splits the words by its own, which is unwanted for me.
for example,

only -> [only]
ONLY -> [ON,L,Y]

stradivarius -> ['St', '##radi', '##vari', '##us']

Is this natural Bert thing or I am doing something wrong ?
","You are not doing anything wrong. Bert uses a so-called wordpiece subword tokenizer as a compromise for meaningful embeddings and acceptable memory consumption between a character-level (small vocabulary) and a word-level tokenizer (large vocabulary).
A common approach to retrieve word embeddings from a subword-based model is to take the mean of the respective tokens. The code below shows you have you can retrieve the word embeddings (non-contextualized and contextualized) by taking the mean. It uses a fasttokenizer to utilize the methods of the BatchEncoding object.
import torch
from transformers import BertTokenizerFast, BertModel

t = BertTokenizerFast.from_pretrained('bert-base-multilingual-cased')
# whole model
m = BertModel.from_pretrained(""bert-base-multilingual-cased"")
# token embedding layer
embedding_layer = m.embeddings.word_embeddings

sample_sentence = 'This is an example with token-embeddings and word-embeddings'
encoded = t([sample_sentence])
# The BatchEncoding object allows us to map the token back to the string indices
print(*[(token_id, encoded.token_to_chars(idx)) for idx, token_id in enumerate(encoded.input_ids[0])], sep=""\n"")
# And we can also check the mapping of word to token indices
print(*[(word, encoded.word_to_tokens(idx)) for idx, word in enumerate(sample_sentence.split())], sep=""\n"")

  contextualized_token_embeddings = m(**encoded.convert_to_tensors(""pt"")).last_hidden_state.squeeze()

word_embeddings = fetch_word_embeddings(sample_sentence, encoded, token_embeddings)
contextualized_word_embeddings = fetch_word_embeddings(sample_sentence, encoded, contextualized_token_embeddings)
print(word_embeddings[""token-embeddings""])

why doesn39t permuting positional encodings in gpt2 affect the output as expected,"I'm trying to understand the role of positional encoding in the GPT-2 Transformer model. From what I understand, positional encodings are crucial because they give the model a sense of the order of tokens.
However, I'm confused about the behavior I'm observing:

Permuting Positional Encodings: When I permute the positional encodings while keeping the input tokens the same, the generated output barely changes. I expected significant changes since the positional information should alter the model’s understanding of token order.

Permuting Input Tokens: When I permute the input tokens (while permuting positional encodings in the same manner), the output changes significantly, but it doesn't revert to what it was with the original order.


This behavior is confusing because I expected the output to revert when both the positional encodings and tokens are permuted in the same way.
Could someone help clarify why this is happening? Is there something about how GPT-2 handles positional encoding that I'm missing? How can I modify my code to get the behavior I expect, where permuting both the positional encoding and input tokens in the same way results in the original output?
Thanks in advance!

    permuted_columns = first_n_columns[:, permutation]

    new_matrix = torch.hstack((permuted_columns, remaining_columns))
    return new_matrix

# permute input
input_ids = permute_columns(input_ids, permutation)

outputs = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=50)
generated_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

I attempted to permute the positional encodings in a GPT-2 model, expecting this to change the generated output. Additionally, I tried permuting the input tokens along with the positional encodings in the same manner, anticipating that the output would revert to the original.
What I Expected:

When permuting only the positional encodings, I expected the output to change significantly because the model should interpret the token order differently.
When permuting both the input tokens and positional encodings in the same way, I expected the output to revert to what it was with the original order.

What Actually Happened:

Permuting only the positional encodings resulted in minimal changes to the generated output, which was unexpected.

Permuting both the input tokens and positional encodings in the same manner led to a different output, but it did not revert to the original as I anticipated.


","You have to consider the effect of the causal attention mask.
CLMs like GPT-2 use an attention mask to prevent tokens from attending to tokens that come later in the sequence. This is important because if this wasn't the case, the model could ""look ahead"" and cheat at the next token prediction task. The attention mask restricts the model such that token i can only attend to tokens j <= i.
Say we have tokens [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Token 0 attends to itself. Token 1 attends to [0, 1] and so on.
Now consider your permutations.
If we permute the positional embeddings, we give the model slightly different signal, but the token order and attention order is still the same. Token 0 still attends to token 0. Token 1 still attends to [0, 1], and so on. As a result, the output is mostly similar to the base case.
Now we permute the token order, say to [3, 2, 0, 4, 1]. Token 3, which used to attend to [0, 1, 2, 3], can now only attend to itself. Token 2, which used to attend to [0, 1, 2] can now only attend to [3, 2]. Token permutation substantially changes what information is routed to what tokens, resulting in a substantial difference in model output.
If you want to look at the effect of token order and positional embeddings in isolation, you should use a BERT-style masked language model that does not use a causal attention mask.

does peft train newly initialized weights,"When using peft to fine-tune a pretrained model e.g., DistilBert, you need to specify the target_modules. In case of DistilBert, typically, the attention weights are targeted. Example:
lora_config = LoraConfig(
    r=8, # Rank Number
    lora_alpha=32, # Alpha (Scaling Factor)
    lora_dropout=0.05, # Dropout Prob for Lora
    target_modules=[""q_lin"", ""k_lin"",""v_lin""], # Which layer to apply LoRA, usually only apply on MultiHead Attention Layer
    bias='none',
    task_type=TaskType.SEQ_CLS # Seqence to Classification Task
)

my question, when finetuning a pretrained model on a downstream task, you initialize a new layer (like classification layer) which is not pre-trained and have random weights, does peft also freeze this layer or does it optimize it?
","When a new task-specific layer, like a classification head, is added to the pretrained model, it is not frozen by default. This layer typically starts with random weights and is trained/optimized along with the LoRA parameters. So basically PEFT focuses on freezing the backbone of the model and it doesn't include any added layers.
You can easily verify the parameters in your model like this:
for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    print(name, param.requires_grad)

The classification head will have requires_grad=True

How can I save the indexes to databases, such that we can organize and concurrently access multiple indexes?
Searched online but could not get much info on this.
Can FAISS be used with any kind of distributed databases?
","In fact, FAISS is considered as an in-memory database itself in order to vector search based on similarity that you can serialize and deserialize the indexes using functions like write_index and read_index within the FAISS interface directly or using save_local and load_local within the LangChain integration which typically uses the pickle for serialization.
If you need to store serialized files, you could manually save them in a NoSQL database like MongoDB as binary data, and then deserialize and retrieve them when needed, however, it is not the best practice!
If you are looking for a vector database that is not in-memory and capable in a scalable system, you might want to consider using Milvus which is designed for this purpose.

","Langchain does not natively support any progress bar for this at the moment with release of 1.0.0
I also had similar case, so instead of sending all the documents, I send independent document for ingestion and tracked progress at my end. This was helpful for me.
You can do the ingestion in the following way

From what I checked from langchain code https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/libs/core/langchain_core/retrievers.py#L31 they are making call to add_texts as well, so no major operation is being performed here other than parsing.
I had simple documents, and I didn't observe much difference. Probably others who has tried on huge documents can add if it adds latency in their usecase.

","Error 10061 means that a connection could not be made, because the target machine actively refused it.
In other words, you're trying to connect to some machine (possibly the machine itself, localhost), but this does not work because the same machine is not listening. This has nothing to do with PDFs; the target machine is refusing to allow you to specify whether you have a PDF, let alone see whether it is a correct PDF or not.
Camelot, per se, does not have to ""listen"" to anything and therefore is not the problem. Perhaps you have installed Excalibur (a separate front-end from Camelot), which should be listening on port 5000.
If that is the case, either the uploading script is not connecting to localhost:5000 but to something else, or the Excalibur is not configured on port 5000 -- or maybe it is not even running; it might not have been properly installed or not activated.
You can confirm this by running a CMD terminal and entering this command:
 netstat -na | find ""5000""

If Excalibur is ready you ought to see something like
 TCP    127.0.0.1:5000      0.0.0.0:0      LISTENING

Better yet, review your code and pinpoint who and where is connecting to anywhere.
Check out and detail your actual setup in the question, then we can see better what is happening.

how to read a bert attention weight matrix,"I have extracted from the last layer and the last attention head of my BERT model the attention score/weights matrix. However I am not too sure how to read them. The matrix is the following one. I tried to find some more information in the literature but it was not successful. Any insights? Since the matrix is not symmetric and each rows sums to 1, I am confused. Thanks a lot !

  tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('Rostlab/prot_bert')
  inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors='pt') 
  attention_mask=inputs['attention_mask']
  outputs = model(inputs['input_ids'],attention_mask) #len 30 as the model layers #outpus.attentions
  attention = outputs[-1]
attention = attention[-1] #last layer attention
layer_attention = layer_attention[-1] #last head attention
#... code to read it as a matrix with token labels

","The attention matrix is asymmetric because query and key matrices differ.
At its core (leaving normalization constants and the multi-head trick aside) (dot-product) self-attention is computed as follows:

Compute key-query affinities (e_ij): given  (T being the sequence length, q_i and k_j being query and key vectors)


Compute attention weights from affinities (alpha_ij):



As you can see, you get the normalization of the affinities by summing over all keys given a query; said differently, in the denominator you're summing affinities by row (thus, probabilities sum to 1 over rows).
The way you should read the attention matrix is the following: row tokens (queries) attend to column tokens (keys) and the matrix weights represent a way to probabilistically measure where attention is directed to when querying over keys (i.e. to which key - and so to which token of the sentence - each query (token) mainly focuses to). Such interaction is unidirectional (you might look at each query as looking for information somewhere in the keys, the opposite interaction being irrelevant). I found the interpretation of the attention matrix as a directed graph within this blogpost very effective.
Eventually, I'd also suggest the first BertViz medium post which distinguishes different attention patterns and according to which your example would fall in the case where attention is mostly directed to the delimiter token [CLS].

What I want to get is the previous lines before the end execution of the script since my myProgramInC.exe always prints info about what is going on and it would be very useful to see what it was happening when the error ocurred. Something like this
c:\myProgramInC.exe
**** Execution of process to get te previous N lines in the command prompt ****
echo ""Ending with error""
PAUSE

I know the cmd window have a buffer and I've been thinking to capture all of this data from such buffer. It is any way to get this info as text to store it in a file?
I'v been trying with something more professional shuch as to make a dump of the memory with ProcDump but since I have various myProgramInC.exe running at the same time (each one stored in a different location) I just get the message ""Multiple processes match the specified name."" and the rest of the options are just not useful for me since my app doesn't get unresponsive, it simply ends.
Any ideas?

how to validate command line input from multiple choice prompt in ruby,"I'm writing a multiple choice quiz where the user has to choose an answer by entering a letter from a to d. Each question prompt looks like this:
What is the last letter in alphabet?
(a) Y
(b) R
(c) Z
(d) Q

If the user enters anything else, I want to show a message and print the whole question again until the input is a, b, c or d.
Here's what I've tried: (simplified)
question = ""What is the last letter in alphabet?\n(a) Y\n(b) R\n(c) Z\n(d) Q""

puts question
answer = gets.chomp.to_s
while answer > ""d""
  puts ""Please enter a, b, c, or d""
  puts
  puts question
  answer = gets.chomp.to_s
end

It works fine when entering e, f, g etc. but it doesn't catch input like ab, 1, Z, or when the user just presses enter.
","Your approach doesn't work because answer > ""d"" compares both strings character-wise using their (Unicode) code points. To understand what this means, take a look at the Basic Latin chart: (it's equivalent to an ASCII table)

""d"" has a codepoint of U+0064. Any smaller codepoint – i.e every character in the chart before ""d"" – is regarded smaller. This includes all (regular) digits, all (basic latin) uppercase letters and several symbols:
""0"" > ""d""  #=> false
""Z"" > ""d""  #=> false

You could add a lower bound like answer < ""a"" || answer > ""d"" but this would still allow all strings starting with one of the allowed characters, e.g.:
""apple"" < ""a"" || ""apple"" > ""d"" #=> false

To actually limit the answer to the four allowed values, you have to compare the string to each of them. You could combine these comparisons:
answer == 'a' || answer == 'b' || answer == 'c' || answer == 'd'

use a loop over an array of allowed values:
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].any? { |letter| answer == letter }

check whether the array includes the answer:
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].include?(answer)

# or

%w[a b c d].include?(answer)

or use a regular expression to match a to d:
answer.match?(/\A[a-d]\z/)

Note that the examples above become true if answer is between a and d. You could either negate the condition via !(...):
while !(%w[a b c d].include?(answer))
  # ...
end

or use until instead of while:
until %w[a b c d].include?(answer)
  # ...
end

","The ""by hand"" method (i.e. putting a for-loop around a call to run_driver()) is the way to do it. No fancy tricks needed.
One feature  you might find helpful is the manual case recording at the problem level. At the end of each point, you can manually record a case with ALL the variables in it. You get to name that case yourself, so you can give it a descriptive name if keeping track of which point is which would be useful to you.

","There was a discussion on the official OpenAI forum. People are saying that they get a different embedding vector for the identical input.
The first reply from Curt Kennedy suggests that there seems to be a difference between the OpenAI API endpoint and the Azure API endpoint for the same model.

Embeddings only return vectors. The vector is the same for the same
input, same model, and the same API endpoint. But we have seen
differences between the OpenAI endpoint and the Azure endpoint for the
same model. So a pick an endpoint and stick with it to avoid any
differences.

Later on, Curt Kennedy adds that some variance is expected.

Some variation is expected because of the random timing in the GPU’s,
and that floating point is not associative, and they are likely taking
the last hidden layer and scaling out to the unit hyper-sphere, which
would magnify the error for hidden states close to the origin.

------------------------------------

As you can see:

The embedding vector is identical all three times.
The dot product is identical all three times (as a consequence of the first point) and very high. This means that the embedding vectors (i.e., the one from MongoDB documentation and generated ones) are very similar.

The discussion on the forum went on about whether this small difference between embedding vectors for the identical input is problematic or not. In other words, should you care about the difference or not? I don't think you should, as long as you get meaningful solutions using them.
Moreover, I would care even less if you got identical embedding vectors for a given API endpoint, model, and input. Don't compare an embedding vector you get when using the OpenAI API endpoint and MongoDB API endpoint. Compare an embedding vector you get when using the OpenAI API endpoint multiple times. Compare an embedding vector you get when using the MongoDB API multiple times. The difference in embedding vectors between the OpenAI API endpoint and MongoDB API endpoint might be of a technical nature, as Curt Kennedy explained on the official OpenAI forum.

set csh prompt to raw output of a command with multiple lines and special characters,"I am trying to set my csh prompt to the raw output of a particular command. I know how to do that for simple outputs; for example:
set prompt=`echo propmt%|sed ""s/pm/mp/""`

... results in a prompt of:
prompt%

But the prompt I want is more complex. First, it has multiple lines. I know how to do that directly (i.e. not via the output of a command):
set prompt=""This is a line\nThis is another\nAnd this is the last% ""

... results in:
This is a line
This is another
And this is the last%

But if I try to do that same thing through a command:
set prompt=`echo ""This is a line\
This is another\
And this is the last% ""`

... the prompt becomes just:
This

... not even This is a line; just This.
On top of that, the specific command that I want to use will output not just multiple lines, but also a bunch of other characters that I assume csh and/or set will interpret in ways that I don't intend. Specifically:

That's what I want as my csh prompt. At this point, I feel obligated to note that I am not kidding.
I suppose I could forget about running a command to generate it, and instead just manually converting it to a single-line string that's properly escaped for set prompt, but:

That seems like a pain;
I'd like to be able to quickly and easily change the prompt to similar but different things.

So, I'm hoping for some way to tell set prompt ""Just use the raw output of (arbitrary-command); don't interpret any of it as special characters or whatever"". Is there a way? Or any alternate suggestions to accomplish what I want? Thanks.
","Maybe it's better to use the precmd alias for this:
alias precmd 'cowsay -f ghostbusters << EOF \
line 1 \
\
line 2 \
\
line 3 \
EOF'

From csh(1):
 precmd  Runs just before each prompt is printed.  For example, if one
         does

               > alias precmd date

         then date(1) runs just before the shell prompts for each command.

         There are no limits on what precmd can be set to do, but
         discretion should be used.

Or you can make it a different file to avoid all the backslashes:
alias precmd 'source ~/cowsay'

# ~/cowsay
cowsay -f ghostbusters << EOF
line 1

line 2

line 3
EOF

  do {
  var result = ui.prompt(
      'Please fill in',
      'Please enter number of people involved',
      ui.ButtonSet.OK_CANCEL);
  var text = parseInt(result.getResponseText());
  var button = result.getSelectedButton();

  while (!(button == ui.Button.CANCEL) && isNaN(parseInt(text)) && !(button == ui.Button.CLOSE));

  var button = result.getSelectedButton();

    ui.alert('Action cancelled.');

You want to exit the while loop only when the value is the positive integer.

If my understanding is correct, how about this modification? I think that there are several answers for your situation. So please think of this as just one of them.
Modified script:

From:

while (!(button == ui.Button.CANCEL) && isNaN(parseInt(text)) && !(button == ui.Button.CLOSE));


To:

while (!(button == ui.Button.CANCEL) && !(/^[0-9]+$/.test(text)) && !(button == ui.Button.CLOSE));

Reference:

test()

If I misunderstood your question, please tell me. I would like to modify it.
Edit:
In your current modified script, for example, if the values like 123-456 and 123abc are inputted, 123 is retrieved. This is due to var text = parseInt(result.getResponseText()).
If you don't want to do this, please modify var text = parseInt(result.getResponseText()) to var text = result.getResponseText(). By this, when such values are inputted, it doesn't exit the while loop.

how can i retrain a llama 2 text generation model into a sequencetosequence model,"LLaMA 2 is a Text Generation Model. Is it possible to re-train the model to make it capable of doing sequence-to-sequence generation, such as translation? I can access LLaMA 2 via the HuggingFace platform.
Alternatively, should I write a prompt to ask LLaMA 2 to translate words and train its translation ability with Q & A style?
Thanks.
","It is definitely possible and certainly one of the better capabilities of such models. Many translation models have been trained in an encoder-decoder transformer structure, including the very first transformer paper.
While you can finetune a model to do specifically translation, you could try to zero-shot or few-shot the inference and it probably should return good results still. Did you know have good enough performance from that?

pass prompt option to a file,"I want to create a script where I have pre-defined option values.
opt1 opt2 opt3
I will start a script and it will ask me to choose from opt1 - opt3.
Once I pick e.g. opt2, that opt2 will then be passed as a variable.
How can I please achieve it?
","You can use the ""case"" command to check if the user value is on a list of expected values:
#!/bin/bash

selected_option=""""

echo "" *** MENU ***""
echo ""1) Opt1""
echo ""2) Opt2""
echo ""3) Opt3""
echo -n "" Please, enter your option: ""
read user_answer

case $user_answer in
  1|2|3) selected_option=""$user_answer""

  *) echo ""Invalid Option!""
esac

##### Show the result only if the user selected an valid option #####
if [[ ! -z ""${selected_option}"" ]]; then
  echo ""Selected Option: [${selected_option}]""
fi

The '|' can be used to separate the valid options, and it will act as an ""or"" operator.
The '*' section will be executed if the previous condition is not satisfied, which means a ""default"" behavior, at this case it will display ""Invalid Option"" message.
Finally, the last if checks if the variable ""${selected_option}"" is empty, if not it is printed, but you can do whatever you want with that.

i get error typeerror cannot read properties of undefined reading 39key39,"I'm experiencing a couple of issues with configuring and using OpenAI in a Firebase function.

Additional Information:
The functions execute normally when deployed to the cloud.
The issue occurs only when running locally with the command:

","When testing locally, use the Firebase Functions emulator. Make sure to set the environment configuration for the emulator as well:
firebase functions:config:get > .runtimeconfig.json

This command creates a .runtimeconfig.json file in your functions directory, which the emulator will use.

why is embedding csv file taking much longer than pdf embedding in langchain,"I successfully embedded a 400-page PDF document within 1-2 hours. However, when I tried to embed a CSV file with about 40k rows and only one column, the estimated embedding time is approximately 24 hours.
Here is the code I used:

embedder = OllamaEmbeddings(model=""nomic-embed-text"", show_progress=True)

file_path = 'filtered_combined_info.csv'

loader = CSVLoader(
    file_path=file_path,
    encoding='utf-8',  # or 'ISO-8859-1' if utf-8 doesn't work
    autodetect_encoding=False  # Set to True if you want to attempt autodetection
)
data = loader.load()

text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(data)

persist_directory = 'db'

vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(documents=docs, 
                                 embedding=embedder,
                                 persist_directory=persist_directory)

Why is the embedding process for the CSV file taking significantly longer than for the PDF file? Are there any optimizations or changes I can make to reduce the embedding time for the CSV file?
Additionally, is there anything I am doing wrong that might be causing it to take so much time?

","I removed everything of Ollama that i installed in my local machine, and moved the installation to the docker.
First start the docker and run the following:
docker run -d --rm -v ./ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama

and then install
docker exec -it ollama ollama run nomic-embed-text

Now use same like this before:
embedder = OllamaEmbeddings(model=""nomic-embed-text"",
                            show_progress=True)

Check the difference:

I don't know how installing on the docker seems increasing the speed but my guess is changing from windows (my machine) to docker Linux worked?

wait for click event inside a for loop  similar to prompt,"This might not have the greatest title. I'm trying to understand call back functions, and I was wondering how replacing prompt() in the following code could be achieved, without losing the for loop?
for(i=0;i<4;i++){
  let x = prompt(""Input an integer"");
  // store input into an array
}

I've tried something like:
for(let i = 0; i<4; i++){
  let x = document.getElementById(""someId"");
  x.addEventListener(""click"", rcvInput(function(i){
    if(i == 3){
      x.removeEventListener(""click"", rcvInput)
    }
  }));
}
function rcvInput(callback){
  //store input into an array
  callback();
}

I know this can be done without the for loop, I'm more curious if callbacks could be able to pause the loop and wait for input?
","Depending on what your end goal is, I'm pretty sure there's a better way to do it. But for the sake of doing that:
You can create a method that returns a promise that resolves when a click happens. Then you can use async/await to do what you need.
By using a Promise and awaiting on it, you can technically ""pause"" your for loop until something happens. In this case, a click.
Remember the method that encloses the for loop has to be async.


function getClick() {
  return new Promise(acc => {
    function handleClick() {
      document.removeEventListener('click', handleClick);
      acc();
    }
    document.addEventListener('click', handleClick);
  });
}


async function main() {
  for (let i=0;i<4;i++) {
    console.log(""waiting for a click"", i);
    await getClick();
    console.log(""click received"", i);
  }
  console.log(""done"");

ollama not saving anything in context,"I am messing around with ollama in C# coding, and managed to get it to give me output, and even interacting with my code, however, Using the example they provided, I am running into an issue where the LLM is not retaining the previous conversations, and i ended up with the sloppy method of injecting the instructions alongside my prompts.
Here is my Code:
public async void Prompt(string prompt)
{
    output = """";
    string input = instructions + prompt;
    context = await ollama.StreamCompletion(input, context, stream => output += (stream.Response));
    Console.WriteLine(output);
}

Output is a string, I might change this to something that can save more variables later.
Context is a ConversationContext variable.
The idea is to give it a prompt that it should follow the whole conversation through, however currently, that needs to be injected through instructions being added Before my prompt. This is not Ideal, as it defeats the purpose of it being an LLM.
What i want to do is:
Inject instruction on launch only.
Call prompts as normal.
Have it follow through with the instruction when needed.
I tried context += But thats not a valid method. I have looked for a solution to this, but I only found one other question regarding this and it was in feb.
","Thanks To Conway i was able to fix my Code. Due to the fact that I am used to programming in Unity I always used Void instead of Task cause I didn't know about it, so to fix what I had, I did:
`
public async Task Prompt(string prompt)
{
    output = """";
    string input = prompt;
    context = await ollama.StreamCompletion(input, context, stream => output += (stream.Response));
    Console.WriteLine(output);
    ConsoleCommands.aIResponse = true;
    ConsoleCommands.checkCommand(output);

Thanks to this, I now have an AI integrated program, that Remembers Prior prompts and conversations.
I hope that this will help someone else in the future!

why doesn39t permuting positional encodings in bert affect the output as expected,"I am working on a Jupyter notebook about Transformers. In the section on positional encodings, I want to demonstrate that the Transformer relies entirely on positional encoding to understand the order of the sequence. I previously learned from another question I posted that this concept only applies to models that don't use masked attention, like GPT-2. However, when I attempted the same approach with a BERT model (which uses cross-attention) to predict a [MASK] token, I encountered unexpected results.
What I expected to happen:

No permutation should cause the model to predict a different token, i.e., distribution A should be consistent over the vocabulary.
Permuting only the input IDs should return distribution B.
Permuting only the positional embeddings should return distribution B.
Permuting both the input IDs and positional embeddings should return distribution A.

What actually happens:
Sometimes the results align with my expectations, but other times, permuting one aspect (either the input IDs or positional embeddings) leads to different outcomes, even though occasionally, they produce the same result.
My question is: Is there something else in Hugging Face's BERT model that might be influenced by position, beyond just the positional encoding?
For completeness, I have included the full code from this part of the notebook below, so it can be tried out directly. The Important part happens in masked_prediction.

","The model inputs have token ids and position ids. There are four scenarios to consider:

Baseline. Correct order for tokens and positions
Permute position ids only
Permute token ids only
Permute position ids and token ids

You are correct that scenario 1 and 4 should produce the same results. However you are incorrect in assuming that permuting tokens or positions separately should give the same result. Consider:
# Given:
tokens = [0, 1, 2]
positions = [0, 1, 2]
permutation = [2, 0, 1]

# Ex1: Permute tokens but not positions
[2, 0, 1] # permuted tokens
[0, 1, 2] # standard positions

# Ex2: Permute positions but not tokens
[0, 1, 2] # standard tokens
[2, 0, 1] # permuted positions

In Ex1, the model is told that token 2 occurs at position 0. In Ex2, the model is told that token 2 occurs at position 1. Even though we used the same permutation, the mapping of tokens to positions is different. This results in different model outputs.
The reason you sometimes see these results line up is because you can (through random chance) sample a permutation that results in token/position embeddings lining up the same way (or mostly the same way) when permuting just one of them. This is luck - the average case produces different results.
It is simple to test this. Huggingface models take a position_ids input parameter. We can use this to test permutations of the input ids without messing with the weight matrices.
To test this, we'll create input data, permute as needed, compute logits and compare logits.
When comparing logits, we will permute or depermute as needed to compare on a token to token basis. For example if token i in scenario 1 is permuted to token j in scenario 3, we want to compare logits i from scenario 1 to logits j in scenario 3.

The code should produce an output like:
Comparison s1, s2: 1.407895
Comparison s1, s3: 1.583560
Comparison s1, s4: 0.000003
Comparison s2, s3: 1.750883
Comparison s2, s4: 1.407894
Comparison s3, s4: 1.583560

Run the code a bunch of times. You will find that the S1, S4 comparison always has a small deviation. This is because permuting tokens and positions together always produces the same result, ignoring small deviations caused by numeric issues.
You will find the S2, S3 comparison generally has a large deviation, but sometimes has a small deviation. As discussed, this is due to getting a lucky permutation where positions and ids mostly line up.

","Problem
You fine-tuned one of the non-chat models but wanted to use the API endpoint, which is compatible only with the chat models.
The API endpoint you need to use for a fine-tuned model depends on the model you fine-tune.
As of today, you can fine-tune the following models:

gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18 (chat model),
gpt-4o-2024-05-13 (chat model),
gpt-4-0613 (chat model),
gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 (chat model),

gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 (chat model),
babbage-002 (non-chat model), and
davinci-002 (non-chat model).

Solution
Use the following rule:

If you fine-tune a chat model, use the /v1/chat/completions API endpoint.
If you fine-tune a non-chat model, use the /v1/completions API endpoint.

In other words:

If you fine-tune a chat model, use the client.chat.completions.create method.
If you fine-tune a non-chat model, use the client.completions.create method.

","Lets take this example from the gapminder dataset. I am just creating a string to extract the year from since that seems to be what you are doing in your code.

I added {{}} to  sub where your variable name normally goes. The {{}} tell dplyr to evaluate whatever column you provide as an argument to year_col instead of the value of year_col. paste is going literally just copy and pasting the argument provided to year select.

library(dplyr)

make_string = gapminder |>

are not valid JSON. Received JSONDecodeError Unterminated string starting at: line 1 column 34 (char 33)

I understand that the call to the llm model returned a malformed string that when parsed as JSON (since I have constrained output), generates an error. I would like to know whether this kind of error can be handled in a way such that the entire process does not fail but only that request. Thanks in advance for your help.
Update
I saw in the langchain documentation that a retry logic is implemented in the library: https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/runnables/langchain_core.runnables.retry.RunnableRetry.html
By defining
tagging_chain = prompt | llm.with_retry()
runnable_each = RunnableEach(bound=tagging_chain)

Would it retry the single input that is failing or the entire input sequence?
","I found the below in the documentation
return_exceptions (bool) – Whether to return exceptions instead of raising them. Defaults to False.

So basically you just have to pass return_exceptions as True to the RunnableEach and it will just return it and not break the whole thing.

Please let me know if there's anything else I can add to post.
","Pointed out by a Contributor of HuggingFace, on this Git Issue,

The library previously named LPOT has been renamed to Intel Neural Compressor (INC), which resulted in a change in the name of our subpackage from lpot to neural_compressor.
The correct way to import would now be from optimum.intel.neural_compressor.quantization import IncQuantizerForSequenceClassification
Concerning the graphcore subpackage, you need to install it first with pip install optimum[graphcore]
Furthermore you'll need to have access to an IPU in order to use it.


Solution
! pip install datasets transformers optimum[graphcore]

Instead of:
from optimum.intel.lpot.quantization import LpotQuantizerForSequenceClassification
from optimum.intel.lpot.pruning import LpotPrunerForSequenceClassification

from optimum.intel.neural_compressor.quantization import IncQuantizerForSequenceClassification
from optimum.intel.neural_compressor.pruning import IncPrunerForSequenceClassification

  // declare both variables (rather than accidentally
  // creating globals):
  let name = prompt(""Hi, what's your name?""),

  // we check if the name is falsey:
  if (!name) {

    // false; if they provide an empty-string that

console.log('Hello,', firstName)

console.write('What is your last name?\n> ')

for the bfloat16 model around 13 Gb (and still not enough to fit basic Colab Cpu instance, given that you'll also need to store intermediate calculations from the model);

I am not sure about this, but you can try this function, pipe it with your compression_retriever chain. The idea of this function is for you to pass it along with the llm or the retriever as the case maybe, so as to make retrieving the docs easier

is there a way to place the prompt cursor at the bottom of the console,"In MSDOS, I wrote a prompt (%PROMPT%) that output a reverse color (white) line at the top of the console with information like MSDOS version and time/date. Then the prompt text ($P$G) and cursor moved to the bottom of the console.  Standard output color was Cyan while the prompt string itself was white.
I don't care about a ""title"" since all windows now have titles. I don't care about the color of the output. I do want the prompt to always appear at the bottom of the console (even after clearing the screen or whatever).

how to change color of prompt from last exit code in zsh,"I have this piece of code in my .zshrc:
autoload -U colors && colors

function change_color() {
    if [[ ""$?"" = 0 ]]; then
    return ""green""

However, the ➜ character stays white, no matter what I do.
","As a function, you need to call it, not expand it as a variable. Do that with a command substitution:
PS1=""...%{$fg[\$(changecolor)]%}➜%b ""

However, there's a lot of bash-like stuff in this prompt that you can replace with simpler, more robust zsh features. First, %F can be used to change the color directly, without using escape codes stored in an array. (Unlike raw escape codes, and like other zsh-defined escape sequences, %F{...} doesn't need to be wrapped in %{...%}.) Second, there is prompt escape specifically for producing one value or another depending on whether the last exit status was 0 or not.
PS1='%B%F{red}[%F{yellow}%n%F{green}@%F{blue}%M '
PS1+='%F{magenta}%~%F{red}] %(?.%F{green}.%F{red})➜%b%f '

%(?.FOO.BAR) expands to FOO if the last command succeeded, BAR otherwise. %f restores the color to the default, regardless of any preceding %F codes.

%(...) is, in fact, more general than just testing the exit code. ? is just one of 20 or so testable conditions. As a silly example, suppose your birthday is coming up on January 18. Here's an escape to put a cake in your prompt on your birthday.
%(0D.%(18d.🎂.).)

['▁']

(I don't really understand what's that strange token with index 1.
Anyway, I was wondering if the Trainer class or the DataCollator actually adds the EOS. I did not find any examples online of how and where to add EOS.
I suspect it's not there, because after training the model it doesn't stop generating until it reaches max_new_tokens (set to pretty high).
What's the best practice here? Where should I add EOS? Is there anything else about this code that should be checked or that looks weird for more experienced eyes?
","The T5 tokenizer should end sequences by EOS token by default. Pretrained T5 tokenizer on HuggingFace does that by default. In fact, I found the function that is responsible for that in the source code on line 256:
def _add_eos_if_not_present(self, token_ids: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        """"""Do not add eos again if user already added it.""""""
        if len(token_ids) > 0 and token_ids[-1] == self.eos_token_id:
            warnings.warn(
                f""This sequence already has {self.eos_token}. In future versions this behavior may lead to duplicated""
                "" eos tokens being added.""
            )
            return token_ids
        else:
            return token_ids + [self.eos_token_id]

If EOS token is not appended by default, you can add a post processor to your tokenizer using TemplateProcessing:
from tokenizers.processors import TemplateProcessing

tokenizer._tokenizer.post_processor = TemplateProcessing(
    single=""$A </s>"",
    pair=""$A </s> $B </s>"",
    special_tokens=[(""</s>"", tokenizer.eos_token_id)]
)

inputs = tokenizer(['Hello world', 'Hello'], padding=True, truncation=True, max_length=100, return_tensors=""pt"")
labels = inputs[""input_ids""]
print(labels)

This should give:
tensor([[1, 10356, 1, 5056, 16001],
        [1, 10356, 16001, 16002, 16002]])

","Turns out the solution was available in this post
If using custom algorithms, and easy way to add metric is to print / log them in the script:
print('METRIC train_accuracy: {}'.format(accuracy))

And in the metric_definitions you have to use the exact same naming in the Regex:
{'Name': 'train_accuracy', 'Regex': ""METRIC train_accuracy: ([0-9]+(.|e\-)[0-9]+)\w+""}

how to specify the langsmith project name for each chain,"According to the LangSmith documentation you need to set the LANGCHAIN_PROJECT environment variable to specify the project name in langsmith.
However, if we want to execute multiple chains within a single service but under different project names, how do we specify the project name at runtime per-chain?
We think we have a solution, but it required looking into the LangChain code, so we are concerned this is not the idomatic way to do it and it might cause issues when their API changes.
This is what we think we should do.

Instantiate the chain.
Instantiate a custom langchain tracer but with a specific project name defined at runtime.
Replace the chain's callbacks with the tracer.

        chain = LLMChain(llm=self._chat_model, prompt=prompt, verbose=True)
        tracer = LangChainTracer(project_name=""whatever"")
        chain.callbacks = CallbackManager(handlers=[tracer])

Thank you in advance for any help.

markdown with code blocks appearing as frontend ui issue in chatgpt responses,"I’m encountering a problem when using ChatGPT to generate Markdown that includes code blocks. Instead of returning proper Markdown output, the content appears to break and render as part of the frontend UI. This is particularly problematic when I need the response in strict Markdown format for documentation purposes.
Example Issue:
I ask ChatGPT for Markdown output like this:
Instead of receiving this as clean Markdown, the response appears to break into a frontend-rendered format where the code sections lose their Markdown formatting.
Attempts to Resolve:

Reformatted the input request to clarify I need the response in Markdown, but the problem persists.
Checked for any embedded rendering settings that might be triggering this, but couldn’t find any.

Expected Behavior:
Markdown output with properly formatted code blocks, such as:
**Description**: Authenticate users and provide a JWT token.  
**Required Role**: Public (No authentication required)  
**Request Body**:  

{
  ""email"": ""user@example.com"",
  ""password"": ""password123""
}


**Response**:
{
  ""token"": ""jwt-token-string"",
  ""user"": {
    ""id"": ""UUID"",
    ""email"": ""user@example.com""
  }
}


Actual Behavior:
The Markdown structure is broken, and the response seems to mix in UI rendering, which makes it unusable in raw Markdown format.

Question:
Has anyone else faced this issue with ChatGPT or other Markdown generators? Is there a specific prompt I should use to ensure the output is pure Markdown? Are there ways to handle this problem effectively, or is this a limitation of the AI?
Any help would be appreciated!
","It's because ChatGPT is wrapping the whole Markdown code into a codeblocks using ```, so the closing ``` in the code close the outer codeblock. To prevent this, you can ask ChatGPT to wrap the Markdown code into ~~~ instead, this will make a codeblock, but since it starts with a different ""tag"" than those in it, it won't break the rendering.

using an aws service to execute a python script that will extract keywords from text using keybert,"I have a simple python script that is given two blocks of text, it then extracts the keywords from them using keyBERT, and then compares the lists of keywords to sort them into two lists depending on if the lists share any keywords.
Which AWS service would best fit my needs? I want to be able to esentially spin this up when needed, give it the blocks of text, and then execute it and return the results, but I don't want to integrate it into my other projects as they don't use python. I've attempted to use lambda but I'm concerned about the potential cost of running this. Thanks.
","In such cases, I would normally think of two resources aligned with the best practices of AWS and software engineering. SageMaker or Lambda. If the model I'm using is resource-intensive and requires GPU acceleration I'd go with SageMaker otherwise Lambda is a good solution. So for your case, here's what I'd do:

Package your KeyBERT script in a lambda and easily deploy it with a container.
Invoke it whenever you need to process text blocks. AWS Lambda charges you only for the execution time, so it’s cost-efficient for occasional tasks.

modelling and fitting bimodal lognormal distributions in a loop using lmfit,"I have been spending FAR too much time trying to figure this out - so time to seek help. I am attempting to use lmfit to fit two lognormals (a and c) as well as the sum of these two lognormals (a+c) to a size distribution. Mode a centers around x=0.2, y=1, mode c centers around x=1.2, y=<<<1. There are numerous size distributions (>200) which are all slightly different and are passed in to the following code from an outside loop. For this example, I have provided a real life distribution and have not included the loop. Hopefully my code is sufficiently annotated to allow understanding of what I am trying to achieve.
I must be missing some fundamental understanding of lmfit (spoiler alert - I'm not great at Maths either) as I have 2 problems:

the fits (a, c and a+c) do not accurately represent the data. Note how the fit (red solid line) diverts away from the data (blue solid line). I assume this is something to do with the initial guess parameters. I have tried LOTS and have been unable to get a good fit.
re-running the model with ""new"" best fit values (results2, results3) doesn't appear to significantly improve the fit at all. Why?

Example result using provided x and y data:

Here is one-I-made-earlier showing the type of fit I am after (produced using the older mpfit module, using different data than provided below and using unique initial best guess parameters (not in a loop). Excuse the legend format, I had to remove certain information):

","There are three main pieces of advice I can give:

initial values matter and should not be so far off as to make
portions of the model completely insensitive to the parameter
values.  Your initial model is sort of off by several orders of
magnitude.
always look at the fit result. This is the primary
result -- the plot of the fit is a representation of the actual
numerical results. Not showing that you printed out the fit
report is a good indication that you did not look at the actual
result. Really, always look at the results.
if you are judging the quality of the fit based on a plot of
the data and model, use how you choose to plot the data to guide
how you fit the data.  Specifically in your case, if you are
plotting on a log scale, then fit the log of the data to the log
of the model: fit in ""log space"".

prompting for bluetooth permission on big sur 1101,"Upon upgrading to Big Sur (macOS 11.0.1), our app is now asking the user to grant permission to use Bluetooth. However, we are not running any bluetooth code to my knowledge. We do link to CoreBluetooth, but it's been like that for a long time, and this prompt has not appeared.
When running in Xcode 12.2 it does crash with this message:
2020-11-13 13:21:58.685610-0800 Fuze[31049:200367] [access] This app has crashed because it attempted to access privacy-sensitive data without a usage description.  The app's Info.plist must contain an NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription key with a string value explaining to the user how the app uses this data.

But to my knowledge, NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription is only applicable for iOS devices.
I suspect this is something new with Big Sur, because the System Preferences UI for Security & Privacy -> Privacy, did not have a Bluetooth section in Catalina, and it does in Bug Sur. But the Apple documentation does not make mention of this key being applicable for macOS.
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nsbluetoothalwaysusagedescription
So my questions are:

Is this key now applicable for macOS and we should have it, even though the documentation says it's only for other platforms, or is there a different key for bluetooth for macOS? I haven't found one.
Is there a way to control this prompting or not, because we aren't actually using the bluetooth code. We need the framework for a particular feature, but it's not applicable for many users, so it's confusing to ask permission for it right when the app launches.

Thank you!
","I'm not confident about this, but I've been running into some Bluetooth on Big Sur strangeness today as well. In my case, I run a Bluetooth peripheral from the Terminal, and I was also recently prompted to provide the Terminal with Bluetooth permission (which I'd never seen before).
For testing purposes, you can try the ""Privacy — Bluetooth Peripheral Usage Description"" or ""Privacy - Bluetooth Always Usage Description"" - and see whether that resolves the crash (I assume it would). It's strange, as I didn't think either of these were required in the past - but it looks like Big Sur is definitely cracking down on permissions.
When you go to ""Signing and Capabilities"", if there is an option to enable ""Hardware -> Bluetooth"" in the ""App Sandbox"" - I would try that out too (you may also need to enable Location, but I can't recall). I'm curious if modifying that flag would change anything regarding permissions.
When you link to CoreBluetooth, are you using the API at all? Because the permission check should happen on the first API call. But, Bluetooth is weird, so it might kick in as soon as the app launches...
In thinking about it, I've actually never optionally used Bluetooth in an app - it's always initialized from app start, so I can't say when the permission check occurs.

ner versus llm to extract name gender role and company from text,"I need to extract the name, gender, job title and employer/company name from newspaper articles, running the process on local hardware (no Cloud allowed) due to copyright reasons.
I've been playing around with Llama 3.1 but I'm finding I don't get useable results with the models smaller than 70B parameters, and at that size the models run much too slowly on the best hardware I have to throw at them.
Is there another, smaller LLM that might be good at this while using fewer processing resources?
Is there is NER I can use to extract all that data? The NERs I've looked into extract name but not gender. (I don't know if they extract the other data because gender is a showstopper for me.)
Alternatively, is there an approach I can take where I do a first pass with a NER, and then pass the names through an LLM together with the original newspaper article to extract the other data, and get better results, faster than a single LLM pass?
Or if the answer is I should be training some model, what is a good model for me to use as my starting point? I'm very much at the beginning of my machine learning journey and would love to be pointed in the right direction.
Thanks in advance!
","Apart from your limitations, I wouldn't recommend using LLMs like Llamma 3.1 for such a task. NER is one of the classic tasks of NLP and there are smaller language models and tools you can incorporate to achieve your goal. You can use NLTK or SpaCy for this matter. My personal choice is SpaCy, however a gender as you defined is not a known named entity. you can see a list of named entities in this doc.
I guess what you mean by gender is the possible gender associated with the names of a PERSON mentioned in your articles. There are a few python packages that you can use to lookup genders, however, you should note that this can be very ambiguous and there should be a substantial tolerance for error. You can use gender-guesser package.
A possible solution would be like this:
import spacy
import gender_guesser.detector as gender


nlp = spacy.load(""en_core_web_sm"")

def extract_info(text):
    doc = nlp(text)
    gender_detector = gender.Detector()

    for ent in doc.ents:
        if ent.label_ == ""PERSON"":
            name = ent.text
            name_gender = gender_detector.get_gender(name)
    
    return doc.ents, name_gender

Note that en_core_web_sm is the small model available via spaCy, you can use the large model by specifying en_core_web_lg, just make sure that the model is downloaded before running your code. here's how you can download the model:
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

how to disable neptune callback in transformers trainer runs,"After installing Neptune.ai for occasional ML experiments logging, it became included by default into the list of callbacks in all transformers.trainer runs. As a result, it requires proper initialisation with token or else throws NeptuneMissingConfiguration error, demanding token and project name.
This is really annoying, I'd prefer Neptune callback to limit itself to warning or just have it disabled if no token is provided.
Unfortunately there is no obvious way to disable this callback, short of uninstalling Neptune.ai altogether. The doc page at https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/callback states that this callback is enabled by default and gives no way to disable it (unlike some other callbacks that can be disabled by environment variable).
Question: how to disable Neptune callback on per run basis?
","The reason Neptune is included is because the default value of report_to in TrainingArguments is ""all"", which implicitly includes all installed loggers from the officially supported list of loggers. You should either uninstall Neptune from the environment you use for the project, or pass report_to=""none"" to the TrainingArguments instance you use to initialize the Trainer (n.b.: that's the string literal ""none"", NOT a Python None).
The other answers here, including the accepted answer, are either poor workarounds for this problem, or simply do not work at all. The proper way to handle this issue is as above.

","First step is convert huggingface model to gguf (16b float or 32b float is recommended) using convert_hf_to_gguf.py from llama.cpp repository.

aggregating output from langchain lcel elements,"I have two chains, one that generates a document and one that creates a short document resume. I want to chain them, using the output from the first on inside the other one. But I want to get both outputs in the result.
Before LCEL, I could do it using LLMChain's output_key parameter. With LCEL, there seems to be a RunnablePassthrough class, but I don't seem to get how to use it to aggregate the output.
Code example:
generate_document_chain = generate_document_prompt | llm | StrOutputParser()
resume_document_chain = resume_document_prompt | llm | StrOutputParser()

aggregated_chain = generate_document_chain | resume_document_chain 
content = aggregated_chain.invoke({""topic"": topic})

","Perhaps the following is what you want. It feeds the output of the first chain into second chain as input.
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough

aggregated_chain = generate_document_chain | {
    ""first_chain_output"": RunnablePassthrough(),
    ""second_chain_output"": resume_document_chain
}
content = aggregated_chain.invoke({""topic"": topic})

Then the output will be a dictionary with keys: ""first_chain_output"" and ""second_chain_output"".
You can also use RunnablePassthrough.assign. Unlike the case above, the key of generate_document_chain output should match the input variable name of the second chain. Below, the input variable of the second chain is  assumed to be ""input"" (btw, the input variable of the first chain is ""topic"").
aggregated_chain = (
    {""input"": generate_document_chain} 
    | RunnablePassthrough.assign(second_chain_output=resume_document_chain)
)

The output of this chain will be a dict with keys: ""input"" and ""second_chain_output"".

how to get text and image embedding of same dimension using huggingface clip,"I am using TFCLIPTextModel and TFCLIPVisionModel to get embedding of texts and images that I need for some downstream tasks. I want the embedding to share the same dimensional space as they do in CLIP. However, as the documentation of these two models suggests the hidden_size of TFCLIPTextModel is 512 while for TFCLIPVisionModel it is 768. So while I extract the last hidden state from these two models, I get embeddings of different dimensions. I am also aware of the projection_dim which is 512 for both these models, but I don't know how to extract the projected features.
Here is my code for the embedding extraction for image and texts.

As said earlier the cls_embeddings and text_embeddings from Text_Embedding_Generator have shape (batch_size, 512) while those from Image_Embedding_Generator have shape (batch_size, 768).
Is there a way to get these two embeddings to same dimensions without needing to train an extra layer on top of these embeddings?
","I figured out the intricacies. For TensorFlow users who are wondering how to get the image and text embeddings to the same dimension without needing to train an extra layer on top of the pre-trained CLIP, here is the way to go.
Instead of using the text and vision models separately, which projects the image and text to different dimensions, we are going to use the combined TFCLIPModel which embeds the text and image together to the same dimension. Following this link, and the example underneath it, I came to the following minimal code to get the embeddings to the same dimension.
import tensorflow as tf
from PIL import Image
import requests
from transformers import AutoProcessor, TFCLIPModel

model = TFCLIPModel.from_pretrained(""openai/clip-vit-base-patch32"")
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(""openai/clip-vit-base-patch32"")

url = ""http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg""
image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

inputs = processor(
    text=[""a photo of a cat"", ""a photo of a dog""], images=image, return_tensors=""tf"", padding=True
)

outputs = model(**inputs)

Now printing outputs.keys() yields:
dict_keys(['logits_per_image', 'logits_per_text', 'text_embeds', 'image_embeds', 'text_model_output', 'vision_model_output'])

I will explain each of the above outputs below
(1) logits_per_image: This is the image-text similarity score, which is basically a cosine similarity weighted by a temperature factor (usually in the range 0.07 to 0.1). Shape if this is (image batch size x text batch size)
(2) logits_per_text: This is the text image similarity score. Similar to the image-text similarity score. Shape of this is (text batch size x image batch size)
(3) text_embeds: This is the text embedding projected to some dimension d. For pretrained CLIP d is 512.
(4) image_embeds: This is the image embedding projected to the same dimension as the text embedding, i.e., d which is 512 for pre-trained CLIP.
(5) text_model_output: This is the output of the underlying text model. So basically while I was doing TFCLIPTextModel.from_pretrained(...) in my text_embedding_generator, I was inadvertently using the output of the text model. Usually for a pre-trained CLIP, the text model output is of dimension 512.
(6) image_model_output: Similar to above but this is the output of the underlying image model which in my case was a ViT. So this output is of dimension 768.
So, to summarize, image_embeds and text_embeds are what we are looking for and for the lazy readers,

In order to get the embeddings to the same dimension use TFCLIPModel and NOT the Vision/Text models


In order to get the vision/text outputs ONLY, one may use the Vision and Text models individually although I don't see a reason to use them as the combined model also gives them.

I appreciate if someone can help me to understand the ""dataset_text_filed"", where do I set ConstantLengthDataset (does it come from packing?).  I also tried with packing = False and provide the dataset_text_field with 'train' and 'text' and they are incorrect.
based on the documentation:
dataset_text_field (Optional[str]): The name of the text field of the dataset, in case this is passed by a user, the trainer will automatically create a ConstantLengthDataset based on the dataset_text_field argument.

","dataset_text_field (Optional[str]) is the name of the field in the training dataset that contains the text that will be used for training only if formatting_func is None.
You should be careful because if you do this:
`dataset_text_field='instruction'

SFTTrainer will only read the text saved in train_dataset['instruction'].
So that Llama2 will only learn to predict the instructions without the answers.
Each line of your dataset(train_data) should have a string saved in 'text' field like this:
train_data[0]['text']=""<s>[INST]<<SYS>>You are an expert in math.<</SYS>>Compute 2+2 [/INST]4 </s>""

And you should do this:
`dataset_text_field='text'

The prompts in the getPassMin() method all work as expected, however the getPassMax() method only returns the proper prompt if the input value is  either greater than 128 or less than 8, i.e the first 2 conditions. All the others simply result in closing the dialog window. I am not currently receiving any errors at any point during execution. Am I missing something?
I have tried copying and reusing the code from the getPassMin() method, and I have also tried re-writing the code from scratch. No success with either.
","Your method getPassMax() cannot see the variable passMin which is causing an error. You could declare the variable passMin outside the scope of both methods, set the value inside getPassMin() and then it can be read inside getPassMax().
Also, be careful. When you've checked the value from the prompt is not null or empty (and against your number pattern or use if (!isNaN(value)) { ... }) then you should convert the value to a number. Currently you are comparing numbers inside strings which won't give you correct results.
You can simply use let value = Number(input); and input will be converted to a number. Now your number comparisons will be correct.

how can i create a loop for a prompt when the answer is unacceptable for a criteria,"so I've been working on a password generator and I have it working aside from 2 things. The password must be within 8-128 characters long. I have a prompt that asks the user how long they would like the password to be and then a few other prompts about including symbols, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers. However, when the user answers with anything bellow 8 or above 128 I would like an alert to say ""password must be at least 8 characters long and shorter than 128"" then loop back to the prompt asking them again how long they would like the password to be.
I can not for the life of me figure out how to do this. the obvious solution to me was a while loop however I am not experienced in building those.
I also want a minimum of one character type selected before the ""confirm"" system ends and to loop back to the beginning of the confirms for upper, lower, symbols, and numbers so the user has to pick at least one.
any help would be greatly appreciated.

does quot0330mquot code zero reset the font color to quottput setafquot or to xterm default color,"I know that you can use escape sequence %{\033[0m%} (code zero) to change the color of the prompt back to ""default"" color (usually, after the prompt).
But what is the ""default"" that is used for this?

Default color of the terminal program itself?
Default color set via tput setaf $COLOR, assuming you use it to set font color different from terminal's default color?
Else?

","It's terminal-dependent, but with regard to existing practice, it would have to be the former:

the default color of the terminal (program).

The other suggested choice would not be correct, since tput setaf does not set a ""default color"", but rather a ""current color"".  Whether any choice of tput setaf corresponds to the terminal's default color is (at best) terminal-specific, since there is no relevant standard one way or the other.
ECMA 48 gives terse (one line) descriptions of SGR 0 (which is what's mentioned in the question), and SGR 30-37, 40-47 (the setaf/setab choices commonly used for terminal descriptions that tput would use).
There's another possible choice, i.e., tput op (selecting the original color pair), which is used in several terminal descriptions to send SGR 39 and 49.  Again, this is terminal-specific and its relationship to SGR 0 is not covered by any standard.  Those happen to use the same ""default color"" for xterm and Linux console, but (read ECMA-48) the standard does not give that level of detail regarding ""default color"" and the absence of ""video attributes"".

I don't quite understand where the values of the target modules come from. Where in the model page should I look to know what the LoRA adaptable modules are?
One example (for the model Falcon 7B):
peft_config = LoraConfig(
    lora_alpha=lora_alpha,
    lora_dropout=lora_dropout,
    r=lora_r,
    bias=""none"",
    task_type=""CAUSAL_LM"",
    target_modules=[
        ""query_key_value"",
        ""dense"",
        ""dense_h_to_4h"",
        ""dense_4h_to_h"",
    ]

Another example (for the model Opt-6.7B):
config = LoraConfig(
    r=16,
    lora_alpha=32,
    target_modules=[""q_proj"", ""v_proj""],
    lora_dropout=0.05,
    bias=""none"",
    task_type=""CAUSAL_LM""
)

Yet another (for the model Flan-T5-xxl):
lora_config = LoraConfig(
 r=16,
 lora_alpha=32,
 target_modules=[""q"", ""v""],
 lora_dropout=0.05,
 bias=""none"",
 task_type=TaskType.SEQ_2_SEQ_LM
)

","Let's say that you load some model of your choice:
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(""some-model-checkpoint"")
Then you can see available modules by printing out this model:
print(model)
You will get something like this (SalesForce/CodeGen25):
LlamaForCausalLM(
  (model): LlamaModel(
    (embed_tokens): Embedding(51200, 4096, padding_idx=0)
    (layers): ModuleList(
      (0-31): 32 x LlamaDecoderLayer(
        (self_attn): LlamaAttention(
          (q_proj): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=4096, bias=False)
          (k_proj): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=4096, bias=False)
          (v_proj): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=4096, bias=False)
          (o_proj): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=4096, bias=False)
          (rotary_emb): LlamaRotaryEmbedding()
        )
        (mlp): LlamaMLP(
          (gate_proj): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=11008, bias=False)
          (down_proj): Linear(in_features=11008, out_features=4096, bias=False)
          (up_proj): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=11008, bias=False)
          (act_fn): SiLUActivation()
        )
        (input_layernorm): LlamaRMSNorm()
        (post_attention_layernorm): LlamaRMSNorm()
      )
    )
    (norm): LlamaRMSNorm()
  )
  (lm_head): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=51200, bias=False)
)

In my case, you can find the LLamaAttention module that contains q_proj, k_proj, v_proj, and o_proj. And this are some modules available for LoRA.
I suggest you reading more about which modules to use in LoRA paper.

different embeddings for same sentences with torch transformer,"Hey all and apologies in advance for what is probably a fairly basic question - I have a theory about what's causing the issue here, but would be great to confirm with people who know more about this than I do.
I've been trying to implement this python code snippet in Google colab. The snippet is meant to work out similarity for sentences. The code runs fine, but what I'm finding is that the embeddings and distances change every time I run it, which isn't ideal for my intended use case.
import torch
from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

# Import our models. The package will take care of downloading the models automatically
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(""qiyuw/pcl-bert-base-uncased"")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(""qiyuw/pcl-bert-base-uncased"")

# Tokenize input texts
texts = [
    ""There's a kid on a skateboard."",
    ""A kid is skateboarding."",
    ""A kid is inside the house.""
]
inputs = tokenizer(texts, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors=""pt"")

# Get the embeddings
with torch.no_grad():
    embeddings = model(**inputs, output_hidden_states=True, return_dict=True).pooler_output

# Calculate cosine similarities
# Cosine similarities are in [-1, 1]. Higher means more similar
cosine_sim_0_1 = 1 - cosine(embeddings[0], embeddings[1])
cosine_sim_0_2 = 1 - cosine(embeddings[0], embeddings[2])

print(""Cosine similarity between \""%s\"" and \""%s\"" is: %.3f"" % (texts[0], texts[1], cosine_sim_0_1))
print(""Cosine similarity between \""%s\"" and \""%s\"" is: %.3f"" % (texts[0], texts[2], cosine_sim_0_2))

I think the issue must be model specific since I receive the warning about newly initialized pooler weights, and pooler_output is ultimately what the code reads to inform similarity:
Some weights of RobertaModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at qiyuw/pcl-roberta-large and are newly initialized: ['roberta.pooler.dense.bias', 'roberta.pooler.dense.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

Switching to an alternative model which does not give this warning (for example, sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2) makes the outputs reproducible, so I think it is because of the above warning about initialization of weights.  So here are my questions:

Can I make the output reproducible by initialising/seeding the model differently?
If I can't make the outputs reproducible, is there a way in which I can improve the accuracy to reduce the amount of variation between runs?
Is there a way to search huggingface models for those which will initialise the pooler weights so I can find a model which does suit my purposes?

Thanks in advance
","You are correct the model layer weights for bert.pooler.dense.bias and bert.pooler.dense.weight are initialized randomly. You can initialize these layers always the same way for a reproducible output, but I doubt the inference code that you have copied from there readme is correct. As already mentioned by you the pooling layers are not initialized and their model class also makes sure that the pooling_layer is not added:
...
self.bert = BertModel(config, add_pooling_layer=False)
...

The evaluation script of the repo should be called, according to the readme with the following command:
python evaluation.py --model_name_or_path qiyuw/pcl-bert-base-uncased --mode test --pooler cls_before_pooler

When you look into it, your inference code for qiyuw/pcl-bert-base-uncased should be the following way:
import torch
from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

# Import our models. The package will take care of downloading the models automatically
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(""qiyuw/pcl-bert-base-uncased"")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(""qiyuw/pcl-bert-base-uncased"")

# Tokenize input texts
texts = [
    ""There's a kid on a skateboard."",
    ""A kid is skateboarding."",
    ""A kid is inside the house.""
]
inputs = tokenizer(texts, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors=""pt"")

# Get the embeddings
with torch.inference_mode():
    embeddings = model(**inputs)
    embeddings = embeddings.last_hidden_state[:, 0]

# Calculate cosine similarities
# Cosine similarities are in [-1, 1]. Higher means more similar
cosine_sim_0_1 = 1 - cosine(embeddings[0], embeddings[1])
cosine_sim_0_2 = 1 - cosine(embeddings[0], embeddings[2])

print(""Cosine similarity between \""%s\"" and \""%s\"" is: %.3f"" % (texts[0], texts[1], cosine_sim_0_1))
print(""Cosine similarity between \""%s\"" and \""%s\"" is: %.3f"" % (texts[0], texts[2], cosine_sim_0_2))

Output:
Cosine similarity between ""There's a kid on a skateboard."" and ""A kid is skateboarding."" is: 0.941
Cosine similarity between ""There's a kid on a skateboard."" and ""A kid is inside the house."" is: 0.779


Can I make the output reproducible by initialising/seeding the model differently?

Yes, you can. Use torch.maunal_seed:
import torch
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

model_random = AutoModel.from_pretrained(""qiyuw/pcl-bert-base-uncased"")
torch.manual_seed(42)
model_repoducible1 = AutoModel.from_pretrained(""qiyuw/pcl-bert-base-uncased"")

torch.manual_seed(42)
model_repoducible2 = AutoModel.from_pretrained(""qiyuw/pcl-bert-base-uncased"")

print(torch.allclose(model_random.pooler.dense.weight, model_repoducible1.pooler.dense.weight))
print(torch.allclose(model_random.pooler.dense.weight, model_repoducible2.pooler.dense.weight))
print(torch.allclose(model_repoducible1.pooler.dense.weight, model_repoducible2.pooler.dense.weight))

Output:
False

how to hide the hostname on the terminal on linux,"Is there a way I can hide the hostname on the terminal without updating the /etc/hosts or related files.
Generally we see the server details on screen as below
[root@ServernamE /]#

So, I don't want the hostname = ServernamE to be displayed on terminal. The reason for doing this is, I will be recording a web session. I know that I can morph the desired part but that is time consuming and depend on other softwares.
Thanks
","If you want a temporary solution(since you are talking about a screencast), you can set your PS1 variable to change the prompt.
For example, if you want your prompt to be:
$

Then set your PS1 variable as follows on the terminal:
export PS1='$ '

Likewise, you can have it to whatever you want the prompt to look like. If you want the path to be displayed, set it as:
export PS1='\w '

For a permanent solution, you can set this in your shell configuration script, which is your ~/.bashrc file in case you have bash as your shell.

    var embeddingGenerator = kernel.Services.GetRequiredService<ITextEmbeddingGenerationService>();
    var memory = new SemanticTextMemory(new VolatileMemoryStore(), embeddingGenerator);

So although we're not using OpenAI we can still use the AddOpenAIChatCompletion method.

color for the prompt just the prompt proper in cmdexe and powershell,"So in Bash you just configure PS1 to add colors to your prompt. I'm talking about the prompt proper, not the color of the foreground (text) or the background. And it's really easy in Bash and it helps a lot if you need to find your commands in a sea of messy text output.
Can you achieve the same for cmd.exe, or as a fallback, for PowerShell? A colored prompt?
I don't know if it could be done in the old days before Win32 by loading ANSI.SYS. I think that was just to make the foreground and the background colorful. But I might be wrong. And anyway, those days are gone, and in our modern times (I know), we're using cmd.exe, or PowerShell.
I know both cmd.exe and PowerShell are capable of colored output. For cmd.exe, just run color /? to find out. But my question is not about the foreground and the background, that's all known to humankind - it's about just changing the prompt color for cmd.exe, probably via the PROMPT environment variable as via the PS1 variable for Bash? Is it possible?
And no, Cygwin is not an alternative for this. I'm a Cygwin user with MinTTY and all, and I love it. But I still want my cmd.exe prompt colored, too.
","Building on @KriZ's answer, the ANSI escape sequences work perfectly in Windows 10 cmd.exe as of 2019. Didn't need to explicitly call out ansi.sys or copy any files. It just worked out of the box in Windows 10.
For example,
set PROMPT=$E[1;37m[user@machine:$E[1;35m$P ]$$ $E[1;37m

Produces: 

(Notice the space after the final $)
Everything before the drive is colored in bold white and the drive/folder is bold pink, and everything after the final $ is bold white.
The format for the colors is:
$E[bold_or_not;colorm

With m always following the color number. bold_or_not = 0 or 1. Here's a guide for the colors:

1     High Intensity
2     Normal Intensity
4     Underline (mono only)

received server error 500 while deploying huggingface model on sgaemaker,"I've successfully fine tuned a sentence-transformers model all-MiniLM-L12-v2 on our data in SageMaker Studio and the model was saved in S3 as a model.tar.gaz.
I want to deploy this model for inference (all code snippets included below). According to HuggingFace doc these types of model required a Custom Inference module. So I've downloaded and unpacked the model.tar.gz created, then followed the tutorial to add the code/inference.py and pushed it back to S3 as new model.tar.gz
The endpoint is created successfully, but as soon as I call the predictor.predict() it crashes with the following error:
ModelError: An error occurred (ModelError) when calling the InvokeEndpoint operation: Received server error (500) from primary with message ""{
  ""code"": 500,

running rest api ollama and nginx reverse proxy,"I want to run Ollama docker image. This exposes entire API with its endpoints.
I want to secure it by adding reverse proxy on top of it and i have chosen Nginx for the job.
So I need to add Nginx to my docker image with Ollama.
So i have constructed such Dockerfile:
FROM ollama/ollama:latest

FROM nginx:latest

COPY /.nginx/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

My Nginx configuration:
server {
    listen 80;
    
    location /api/tags {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:11434/api/tags;
        proxy_set_header Host localhost:11434;
    }
    
    # Default: Return 404 for all other endpoints
    location / {
        return 404;
    }
}

Here I allow just one endpoint to be proxied to Ollama.
In order to test it, I tried some endpoints and they returned correctly 404.
But when I have tried api/tags path, I got ""Bad gateway"" 502 error.
In docker logs I could see:

It seems that Ollama server is not running, but I don't know:

How to check running processes in Docker, ps command is not found in docker.
How to run Ollama server?
How to define in Docker to start Ollama server automatically?

","You can't create a Docker image containing multiple programs the way you're trying. The Dockerfile you have will result in an image that only contains Nginx and not Ollama. It's also generally recommended to only have one process running in a container.
I'd recommend running Ollama and Nginx in each their own containers and orchestrate them using Docker Compose.
Create a docker-compose.yml file containing
services:
  ollama:
    image: ollama/ollama:latest
  nginx:
    build: .
    ports:
      - 80:80

Then change your nginx.conf file so it passes the request to the Ollama container by using the ollama service name instead of localhost like this:
server {
    listen 80;
    
    location /api/tags {
        proxy_pass http://ollama:11434/api/tags;
        proxy_set_header Host localhost:11434;
    }
    
    # Default: Return 404 for all other endpoints
    location / {
        return 404;
    }
}

Your Dockerfile will work as is, since the first line is effectively ignored. But to keep things tidy, you should change it to
FROM nginx:latest

COPY /.nginx/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

docker compose up -d will start both containers. When a request comes in to Nginx on http://localhost/api/tags it'll pass it on to the Ollama container on /api/tags on port 11434.

how to reconstruct text entities with hugging face39s transformers pipelines without iob tags,"I've been looking to use Hugging Face's Pipelines for NER (named entity recognition). However, it is returning the entity labels in inside-outside-beginning (IOB) format but without the IOB labels. So I'm not able to map the output of the pipeline back to my original text. Moreover, the outputs are masked in BERT tokenization format (the default model is BERT-large).
For example: 
from transformers import pipeline
nlp_bert_lg = pipeline('ner')
print(nlp_bert_lg('Hugging Face is a French company based in New York.'))

The output is:
[{'word': 'Hu', 'score': 0.9968873858451843, 'entity': 'I-ORG'},
{'word': '##gging', 'score': 0.9329522848129272, 'entity': 'I-ORG'},
{'word': 'Face', 'score': 0.9781811237335205, 'entity': 'I-ORG'},
{'word': 'French', 'score': 0.9981815814971924, 'entity': 'I-MISC'},
{'word': 'New', 'score': 0.9987512826919556, 'entity': 'I-LOC'},
{'word': 'York', 'score': 0.9976728558540344, 'entity': 'I-LOC'}]

As you can see, New York is broken up into two tags.
How can I map Hugging Face's NER Pipeline back to my original text?
Transformers version: 2.7
","EDIT 12/2023:
As pointed out, the grouped_entities parameter has been deprecated. The correct way is to use the aggregation_strategy parameters as pointed in the source code .
For instance:
text = 'Hugging Face is a French company based in New York.'
tagger = pipeline(task='ner', aggregation_strategy='simple')
named_ents = tagger(text)
pd.DataFrame(named_ents)

Gives the following output
[
   {
      ""entity_group"":""ORG"",

ORIGINAL ANSWER:
The 17th of May, a new pull request https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/3957 with what you are asking for has been merged, therefore now our life is way easier, you can you it in the pipeline like
ner = pipeline('ner', grouped_entities=True)

and your output will be as expected. At the moment you have to install from the master branch since there is no new release yet. You can do it via
pip install git+git://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git@48c3a70b4eaedab1dd9ad49990cfaa4d6cb8f6a0

trainer huggingface  runtimeerror cannot pin 39torchcudafloattensor39 only dense cpu tensors can be pinned,"I recently got the following error:
RuntimeError: cannot pin 'torch.cuda.FloatTensor' only dense CPU tensors can be pinned

I saw on a discord someone saying:

The issue likely stems from the fact that you are manually placing
your inputs on the GPU (with to(model.device)), but the Trainer
expects data to be on the CPU and will handle the transfer to the GPU
internally.

I can't find anything of the sort written in the Trainer documentation of huggingface https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/trainer.

unexpected value passed to langchain tool argument,"I'm new to LLMs, AI app development, and LangChain.
I'm trying to create a simple example tool that creates new user accounts in a hypothetical application when instructed to do so via a user prompt. The llm being used is llama3.1:8b via Ollama.
So far what I've written works, but it's very unreliable.
The reason why it's unreliable is because when LangChain calls on my tool, it provides unexpected/inconsistent values to the user creation tool's single username argument.
Sometime the argument will be a proper username and other times it will be a username with the value ""username="" prefixed to the username (eg: ""username=jDoe"" rather than simply ""jdoe"").
Also, if I ask for multiple users to be created, sometimes langchain will correctly invoke the tool multiple times while other times, it will invoke the tool once with a string in the format of an array (eg: ""['jDoe','jSmith']"")
What I've just explained is my problem.
My questions to everyone are:

Is the issue I'm encountering due to the limitations of LangChain or the Llama3.1:8b model that I'm using? Or is the issue something else?
Is there a way to get LangChain to more reliably call my user creation tool with a correctly formatted username?
Are there are other useful tips/recommendations that you can provide for a beginner like me?

Below is my code:
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, create_react_agent
from langchain.tools import Tool
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_ollama.chat_models import ChatOllama

","Prompt engineering (what you are attempting here), is far from an exact science.  However, there are ways you can clarify the schema of the tool.
One example (from their docs) is getting it to parse your docstrings:
@tool(parse_docstring=True)
def create_user(username: str):
    """"""Creates a user

        Args:
            username: username of the user to be created. The exact string of the username, no longer than 20 characters long
    """"""
    ... # Rest of your code here

See docs here
But even more reliable would be to create your schema with Pydantic (great tool in general), again, from their docs:

class create_user(BaseModel):
    """"""Creates a user""""""

    username: str = Field(..., description=""username of the user to be created. The exact string of the username, no longer than 20 characters long""

In general, the more detail you provide, regarding the shape and nature of the tools and the data, the better results you can expect.
You may also want to consider setting your temperature to 0, so you get repeatable responses for any given prompt, which should help with debugging, but you need to test with a higher range of prompts to ensure reliable behaviour

is it possible to configure the irb prompt to change dynamically,"I'd like to navigate around the filesystem in IRB and have the prompt change to reflect the current working directory, but I can't figure out how to make the prompt update after each command. Ultimately I'd like to use IRB in day to day work a lot more and let bash slip away. I tried this in my .irbrc:
require 'fileutils'
include FileUtils

IRB.conf[:PROMPT][:CUSTOM] = {
    :PROMPT_N => ""\e[1m:\e[m "",
    :PROMPT_I => ""\e[1m#{pwd} >\e[m "",

/users/julianmann > puts pwd
/users/julianmann
/users/julianmann > cd 'dev'
/users/julianmann > puts pwd
/users/julianmann/dev
/users/julianmann > 

I'd really like the prompt to change.
","Here's a quick hack to get the working dir. It's sort of fragile, but it worked on ruby 1.8.7 and 1.9.2.
Set your prompt string to something like this:
""%N(%m):%03n:%i %~> "".tap {|s| def s.dup; gsub('%~', Dir.pwd); end }

The ""%~"" directive is not understood by irb itself, so I used it to do the replacement. This hack relies on the fact that irb calls dup to generate the prompt.

","not sure what you want to accomplish. Based on the printscreen you are using the standard automatically generated Prompt object on a Foreign Key. The popup will select the value and return and assign on the caller the selection. Then, based on ajax when transitioning between fields will get secondary attributes values based on that selection (if any).
You could use a custom prompt with a rule and change the out parameters to receive more information on the caller. Other option would be to use other events on that field (ControlValueChanged/IsValid?) and add some coding.

methods to reduce a tensor embedding to xyz coordinates,"I have a model from hugging face and would like to use it for performing word comparisons. At first I thought of performing a series of similarity calculations across words of interest but quickly I found that this problem would exponentially grow as the number of words expanded as well.
A solution I thought about is plotting a skip gram where all words result on a 2 dimensional plane and then can simply perform clustering on the coordinates to find similar words. The problem here is that this requires a bert model and a low embedding layer that can be mapped.
As I have a pretrained model, I don't know if I can create a skip gram with from it. I was hoping to calculate the embedding and through the use of a transformation, convert the embedding into coordinates that I can plot myself. I though do not know if this is possible or reasonable
I tried to do it though with the code below
from sklearn.manifold import TSNE
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

# target word
word = [""Slartibartfast""]

# model setup
model = 'Alibaba-NLP/gte-multilingual-base'

# embbed and calculate

result = auto_model(**batch_dict)

embedding_numpy = embeddings.detach().numpy()
clayer.fit_transform(embedding_numpy)  # crashes here saying perplexity must be less than n_samples

","After more through reading, it was brough to my attention that it would be impossible to use TSNE in the manner which I was hoping as the dimensions generated by TSNE is only representative of the training data. Further fitting with new data or transformation of data not within the training set would result in outputs that are not on a similar range and thus noncomparable.
I found a replacement to TSNE which is called umap. umap is also for dimension reduction but it can be fitted multiple times and data can be transformed along the same range.
I will explore umap and see if it will work for what I need.

Here's how you can modify your indices_delete function to include this feature:

Add a prompt for user confirmation when the environment is ""Prod"".
List indices to be deleted and get confirmation from the user before proceeding.
Proceed with deletion only if the user confirms.

strange results with huggingface transformermarianmt translation of larger text,"I need to translate large amounts of text from a database. Therefore, I've been dealing with transformers and models for a few days. I'm absolutely no data science expert and unfortunately I don't get any further.
The problem starts with longer text. The 2nd issue is the usual-maximum token size (512) of the sequencers. Just truncating is not really an option. Here I did  find a work-around, but it does not work properly and the result is a word salad on longer texts (>300 sequences)
Here an Example (please ignore the warnings, this is another issues - which does not hurt currently that much);
If i take the Example Sentence 2 (55 seq) or 5 times (163 sequences) - no issues.
But it get messed up with e.g. 433 sequences (the 3rd green text block in the screenshot).

With more than 510 sequences, I tried to split it up in chunks as in the upper described link. But the result here is as well pretty strange.
I am pretty sure - that I have more than just one mistake and underestimated this topic.
But I see no alternative (free/cheap) way for translating big amount of text.
Can you guys help me out? Which (thinking) errors do you see and how would you suggest to solve the issues? Thank you very much.

I really appreciate any help that can be given!
I'm expecting, based on the OpenAI documentation, to convert the file to base64 to send to the chat completion endpoint. Is there an easier, or better way to do this?
","I believe your goal is as follows.

You want to download files except for Google Docs files (Document, Spreadsheet, Slides and so on) as base64 data.
You want to achieve this using googelapis for Node.js.

In this case, how about the following modification?
Modified script:
const fileId = ""file_id_string""; // Please set your file ID.

const fileDownload = await driveApi.files.get(
  { fileId, alt: ""media"" },
  { responseType: ""stream"" }
);
let buf = [];
fileDownload.data.on(""data"", (e) => buf.push(e));
fileDownload.data.on(""end"", () => {
  const buffer = Buffer.concat(buf);
  const base64String = buffer.toString(""base64"");
  console.log(base64String);
});

Or, when responseType: ""arraybuffer"" is used, how about the following modification?
const fileId = ""file_id_string""; // Please set your file ID.

const fileDownload = await driveApi.files.get(
  { fileId, alt: ""media"" },
  { responseType: ""arraybuffer"" }
);
const base64String = Buffer.from(fileDownload.data).toString(""base64"");
console.log(base64String);


By this, the downloaded file is converted to the base64 data in base64String.

I tried changing up the structure of the code, I uninstalled Flask and reinstalled it again. I've also extensively used chatgpt to try and come up with better code but it just kept taking me in circles. I'm hoping someone can help with this. I even tried a simple server that just said hello world which worked, but I truly think the issue might be with my javascript. Also, I am a beginner and this is supposed to be one of my first coding projects so please take it easy on me if possible. Thanks.

how to print input requests and output responses in ollama server,"I'm working with Langchain and CrewAI libraries to gain an in-depth understanding of system prompting. Currently, I'm running the Ollama server manually (ollama serve) and trying to intercept the messages flowing through using a proxy server I've created.
The goal is to log or print the input requests and output responses for debugging and analysis purposes.
Can anyone suggest a better way to achieve this?
","For Ubuntu Users:
To print out the input request on the server side, you need to enable Debug mode. Follow these steps:

Open Ollama's service file:
sudo systemctl edit --full ollama.service

Add the following line in the [Service] section:
Environment=""OLLAMA_DEBUG=1""

Restart the Ollama service:
sudo systemctl restart ollama.service

Read the service logs to view debug information:
journalctl -f -b -u ollama


This will enable Debug mode and allow you to see detailed logs for input requests.

how to extract image hidden states in llava39s transformers huggingface implementation,"I am using the transformers library (Huggingface) to extract all hidden units of LLaVa 1.5.

how to ask multiple choice questions using pipeline,"I want to ask multiple choice questions to the Hugging Face transformer pipeline; however, there does not seem to be a good task choice for this.
I am referencing this:
qa_pipeline = pipeline(""question-answering"", model=""distilbert-base-uncased"")
result = qa_pipeline(question = question, context = context)

I know question-answering exists; however, this task requires context where then the pipeline would extract the answer from the context. For specifically multiple choice answering, this method does not make much sense because I am trying to recieve a specific letter, not a word associated with the letter. Additionally, I could possiblely try text-generation, but I was hoping there was some better solution than this. Let me know your thoughts!
","You could hand multiple sentence pairs to the model and then infer which one gives you the highest probability:

When I run the script with parallel_group, I have those results very consistently:

I ran the previous code several times and results were consistent.
Edit :
the url is the chat completion api of openai =""api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions""
","Your function parallel_group isn't doing what you would hope. The reason is that of the 3 parameters you're passing to requests.post, only the first one is correct (the URL).

using the pipeline_kwargs in huggingface.py file i was able to find the variable i could use although using this method will render the quantization method a bit useless as you will consume more memory upon increasing the tokens

loss becomes nan after attention_mask is added to the model while finetuning gemma2,"I was trying to fine-tune gemma2 2b model on my own dataset for sequence classification tasks. But when I was testing the model, I found that after I plugged in the attention_mask to the model, the loss becomes Nan.
Here is my code
from peft import get_peft_model, LoraConfig, TaskType
from transformers import (AutoTokenizer,Gemma2ForSequenceClassification,DataCollatorWithPadding)

raw_t=tokenizer(['I like it too'],return_tensors='pt',padding='max_length',max_length=10).to('cuda')
 
print(model(input_ids=raw_t.input_ids ,attention_mask=raw_t.attention_mask ,labels=label))

If I don't plug in the attention_mask, the loss looks fine.
Besides, I noticed that if I don't pad the input to the max_length(attention_mask is all 1s), the problem won't occur.
And if I change the precision to float16, the loss seems normal too.
Could anyone help me solve the problem?

detecting unsaved changes,"I have a requirement to implement an ""Unsaved Changes"" prompt in an ASP .Net application.  If a user modifies controls on a web form, and attempts to navigate away before saving, a prompt should appear warning them that they have unsaved changes, and give them the option to cancel and stay on the current page.  The prompt should not display if the user hasn't touched any of the controls.
Ideally I'd like to implement this in JavaScript, but before I go down the path of rolling my own code, are there any existing frameworks or recommended design patterns for achieving this?  Ideally I'd like something that can easily be reused across multiple pages with minimal changes.
","Using jQuery:
var _isDirty = false;
$(""input[type='text']"").change(function(){

Combine with onunload/onbeforeunload methods as required.

how to remove items from langchain memory,"inside the langchain memory object there are different methods e.g. ConversationBufferMemory or ConversationBufferWindowMemory
Regardless, if the conversation get long at somepoint I get the following error
openai.error.InvalidRequestError: This model's maximum context length is 4097 tokens. However, your messages resulted in 4113 tokens (4063 in the messages, 50 in the functions). Please reduce the length of the messages or functions.

because the context get full. I wonder how I can remove the last object or apply some moving window strategy ?
","If memory is an instance of ConversationBufferMemory, for example, you can access past messages with memory.chat_memory.messages.
The method memory.clean() sets memory.chat_memory.messages to an empty list, so it deletes all memory. See here and here for the respective code parts. What you can do is
memory.chat_memory.messages = memory.chat_memory.messages[:-2]

to, for example, delete the last two messages.
To overwrite them, you could then use
memory.save_context({""input"": ""Servus""}, {""output"": ""Grüezi!""})

update Oct 2024
I could delete last 8 instances by
memory.messages = memory.messages[:-8]
where memory is created at the beginning using
memory = ChatMessageHistory()

fine tuning a pretrained language model with simple transformers,"In his article 'Language Model Fine-Tuning For Pre-Trained Transformers' Thilina Rajapakse (https://medium.com/skilai/language-model-fine-tuning-for-pre-trained-transformers-b7262774a7ee)
provides the following code snippet for fine-tuning a pre-trained model using the library simpletransformers:
from simpletransformers.language_modeling import LanguageModelingModel
import logging


logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
transformers_logger = logging.getLogger(""transformers"")
transformers_logger.setLevel(logging.WARNING)

train_args = {
    ""reprocess_input_data"": True,
    ""overwrite_output_dir"": True,
}

model = LanguageModelingModel('bert', 'bert-base-cased', args=train_args)

model.train_model(""data/train.txt"", eval_file=""data/text.txt"")

model.eval_model(""data/test.txt"")

He then adds:

We assume that you have combined all the text in your dataset into two
  text files train.txt and test.txt which can be found in the data/
  directory.

I have 2 questions:
Question 1
Does the highlighted sentence above implies that the entire corpus will be merged into one text file?  So assuming that the Training Corpus is comprised of 1,000,000 text files, are we supposed to merge them all in one text file with code like this?
import fileinput
with open(outfilename, 'w') as fout, fileinput.input(filenames) as fin:
    for line in fin:
        fout.write(line)

Question 2
I presume that I can use the pretrained model: bert-base-multilingual-cased.  Correct?
","Question 1
Yes, the input to the train_model() and eval_model() methods need to be a single file.
Dynamically loading from multiple files will likely be supported in the future
Question 2
Yes, you can use bert-base-multilingual-cased model.
You will find a much more detailed, updated guide on language model training here.

I want to pass my own 'context' that is prepared and parsed from retriever. I do not want retriever to be called again but from what I've read - retrieving happens by itself if chat_history does not contain the answer.
prompt variable is created:
prompt_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(PROMPT_TEMPLATE)
prompt = prompt_template.format(context=metadata_context, input=query_text)

As you can see I am trying to put the context everywhere but no success.
The 'context' I can see when calling
conversational_rag_chain.invoke({""input"": query_text, ""context"": metadata_context}, config={""configurable"": {""session_id"": f""{session_id}""}},)
        logger.info(f""Response generated."")

is the result of retriever:

The code I'm using is as follows:
chroma_client = chromadb.HttpClient(host=DB_HOST, port=DB_PORT)
chroma_collection = chroma_client.get_collection(os.getenv(""DB_COLLECTION""))

vectorstore = VStoreChroma(DB_COLLECTION, embedding_function, client=client)

    llm,
    vectorstore,
    document_content_description,
    metadata_field_info,
    search_kwargs = {""k"": 10}

def self_query(query_text):
    model = llm
    logger.info(""Data retrieval has started."")
    try:
        result = retriever.invoke(query_text)
        logger.info(""Data retrieved from database."")

            logger.info(f""Unable to find matching results."")
    except Exception as e:
        return ({'Retrieval failed: ': str(e)})
    return result

Retrieving is alright I get correct results. The problem is that the context I prepare from metadata by parsing it with the function like the one you mention in your snippet. It is string and I do not get it where I can pass it so the context is used properly. The rest is as I mentioned before.

It now looks exactly like this, and it still gives back a syntax error on the first elif statement. I don't understand what the problem is if it's properly indented and should follow the correct rules to use it.
edited with error: https://i.sstatic.net/rTW6k.png
The syntax error is finally gone, but now lies the problem where the code just repeats itself on the menu screen without going anywhere, like this:
repeating: https://i.sstatic.net/YNPdF.png
","I would do something like this:
while True:
    print(<instructions>)
    option = input(""Enter an option: "")
    if option == ""1"":
        do stuff...
    elif option == ""2"":
        do number two stuff..
    elif option == ""3"":
        do that third stuff..
    elif option == ""4"":
        print(""Thank You For Shopping With Us!"")
        break
    else:
        print(""That's not a valid answer! Try again!"")

This will keep the menu in a loop and if option 4 is selected, it will break from the loop and continue on.
The issue now is with your indentation. You must indent your code properly for python to be able to understand what you want it to do, for instance:
x= ""3""
if x == ""2"":
    print(""hello world"")
print(""outside the indent"")

you console output would be:
>>outside the indent

but if your code looks like this:
x= ""3""
if x == ""2"":
    print(""hello world"")
    print(""outside the indent"")

you would get no output from the console, everything is within the ""if"" code block. Indentation is crucial for python to exhibit the expected behavior. you need to make sure that all your code for each condition is indented properly inside the if blocks, like the example I gave above. Also, if you want this in a loop, you need to put it in a loop with the while True: statement, and indent everything inside it.
Your final result should look something like this:
peoples = {
    ""Mary"": {
        ""name"": ""Mary"",
        ""budget"": 100,
        ""items"": {
            ""Game"": 0,

how to let prompt read text input amp print out customised text messages,"I'm trying to do a text adventure game using basic JS. Basically, a user will have 2 options, and the prompt box should print out corresponding messages based on choices the user make.
I'm guessing that what missing is an event listener--but I'm not sure how to go about implementing that.


let message = prompt(""Hi this is an adventure. Select your input as A or B. In front of you there is a sign. Pick  A. Forest B. Lake"")

if (A) {
  prompt(""you see the bushes ahead of you rustling.You-- A.proceed ahead  B.turn back and run"")
};
else if (B) {
  prompt(""you see the water bubbling. You--A. walk up B.--flee"")

","You need to compare if (message.toUpperCase() === ""A"") { to allow user to type a or A

 plpgsql | 1.0     | pg_catalog | PL/pgSQL procedural language
 vector  | 0.4.1   | public     | vector data type and ivfflat access method

I've tried the following ways to resolve:

Fresh installing the Postgres docker image with pgvector extension enabled.
Manually install the extension with the official instruction.
Manually install the extension on Postgres like the following:

CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector
    SCHEMA public
    VERSION ""0.4.1"";

But no luck.
","Update 17th July 2023
As previously I mentioned my issue was somewhere else in my configuration, here is the other reason that may be responsible for the error,

The pgvector extension isn't enabled in the database you are using. Make sure you run CREATE EXTENSION vector; in each database you are using for storing vectors.
The vector schema is not in the search_path. Run SHOW search_path; to see the available schemas in the search path and \dx to see the list of installed extensions with schemas.


Unfortunately, the issue was somewhere else. My extension installation and search_path schema were totally okay for the defined database I was supposed to use. But my environment variable which was responsible for which database to use, got messed up and was using the default database postgres instead of my defined database, which didn't have the extension enabled.

I need to create the large language model variable.
","I also had a similar error, I'm using langchain==0.1.4 in which its google_palm file suggests deprecation of GooglePalm and it is replaced with
langchain_google_genai.GoogleGenerativeAI
Make use of GoogleGenerativeAI instead;
for its installation follow these steps:

pip install --upgrade --quiet langchain-google-genai
pip install -q -U google-generativeai

Then use this code:
from langchain_google_genai import GoogleGenerativeAI

llm = GoogleGenerativeAI(model=""models/text-bison-001"", google_api_key=SECRET_KEY, temperature=0.1)

Use Google Palm API key.

how to work with openai maximum context length is 2049 tokens,"I'd like to send the text from various PDF's to OpenAI's API. Specifically the Summarize for a 2nd grader or the TL;DR summarization API's.
I can extract the text from PDF's using PyMuPDF and prepare the OpenAI prompt.
Question: How best to prepare the prompt when the token count is longer than the allowed 2049?

Do I just truncate the text then send multiple requests?
Or is there a way to sample the text to ""compress"" it to lose key points?

","I faced the same problem. Here is the strategy I used to send text that is much, much longer than OpenAIs GPT3 token limit.
Depending on the model (Davinci, Curie, etc.) used, requests can use up to 4097 tokens shared between prompt and completion.

Prompt being the input you send to OpenAI, i.e. your ""command"", e.g. ""Summarize the following text"" plus the text itself
Completion being the response, i.e. the entire summary of your text

If your prompt is 4000 tokens, your completion can be 97 tokens at most. For more information on OpenAI tokens and how to count them, see here.
To ensure that we don’t exceed the maximum length limit for prompt plus completion, we need to ensure that prompt (i.e. your text) and completion (i.e. the summary) put together always fits into the 4097 token boundary.
For that reason we split the entire text into multiple text chunks, summarize each chunk independently and finally merge all summarized chunks using a simple "" "".join() function.
Maximum Number of Words - Token-to-Word Conversion
OpenAI has a fixed limit on the number of tokens. However, a token is not the same as a word. Hence, we first need to calculate the maximum number of words we can send to OpenAI. The documentation says:

Given the token-to-word ratio, we can send approximately 2900 words to OpenAI's GPT3 assuming a 5 sentence summary per text chunk.

Max tokens per request: 4000 tokens (leaving 97 tokens as a safety buffer) = 3000 words
Max prompt tokens: “Summarize the following text in five sentences” has 7 words = 10 tokens
Max tokens of returned summary (5 sentences): 20 words per sentence. 5 * 20 = 100 words = 133 tokens
Max tokens of text chunk: 4000 - 10 - 133 = 3857 tokens = 2900 words

Text Chunking
We can choose from a plethora of strategies to split up the entire text into smaller chunks.
The simplest approach is creating a single list of all words by splitting the entire text on whitespaces, and then creating buckets of words with words evenly distributed across all buckets. The downside is that we are likely to split a sentence half-way through and lose the meaning of the sentence because GPT ends up summarizing the first half of the sentence independently from the second half — ignoring any relations between the two chunks.
Other options include tokenizers such as SentencePiece and spaCy’s sentence splitter. Choosing the later generates the most stable results.
Implementation of Text Chunking with spaCy
The following example splits the text “My first birthday was great. My 2. was even better.” into a list of two sentences.
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

import spacy
from spacy.lang.en import English

nlp = spacy.load(""en_core_web_sm"")

text = ""My first birthday was great. My 2. was even better.""
    
for sentence in nlp(text).sents:
  print(sentence.text)

Output
My first birthday was great.
My 2. was even better.

spaCy correctly detected the second sentence instead of splitting it after the “2.”.
Now, let’s write a text_to_chunks helper function to generate chunks of sentences where each chunk holds at most 2700 words. 2900 words was the initially calculated word limit, but we want to ensure to have enough buffer for words that are longer than 1.33 tokens.
def text_to_chunks(text):
  chunks = [[]]
  chunk_total_words = 0

  sentences = nlp(text)

  for sentence in sentences.sents:
    chunk_total_words += len(sentence.text.split("" ""))

    if chunk_total_words > 2700:
      chunks.append([])
      chunk_total_words = len(sentence.text.split("" ""))

    chunks[len(chunks)-1].append(sentence.text)
  
  return chunks


An alternative approach to determine the number of tokens of a text was recently introduced by OpenAI. The approach uses tiktoken and is tailored towards OpenAI's models.
import tiktoken

encoding = tiktoken.encoding_for_model(""gpt-3.5-turbo"")
number_of_tokens = len(encoding.encode(""tiktoken is great!""))
print(number_of_tokens)


Next, we wrap the text summarization logic into a summarize_text function.
def summarize_text(text):
  prompt = f""Summarize the following text in 5 sentences:\n{text}""

  response = openai.Completion.create(
      engine=""text-davinci-003"", 
      prompt=prompt,
      temperature=0.3, 
      max_tokens=150, # = 112 words
      top_p=1, 
      frequency_penalty=0,
      presence_penalty=1
  )

  return response[""choices""][0][""text""]

Our final piece of code looks like this:
chunks = text_to_chunks(one_large_text)

chunk_summaries = []

for chunk in chunks:
  chunk_summary = summarize_text("" "".join(chunk))
  chunk_summaries.append(chunk_summary)

summary = "" "".join(chunk_summaries)

why rag is slower than llm,"I used RAG with LLAMA3 for AI bot. I find RAG with chromadb is much slower than call LLM itself.
Following the test result, with just one simple web page about 1000 words, it takes more than 2 seconds for retrieving:
Time used for retrieving: 2.245511054992676
Time used for LLM: 2.1182022094726562

Here is my simple code:
embeddings = OllamaEmbeddings(model=""llama3"")
vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=embeddings)
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()
question = ""What is COCONut?""
start = time.time()
retrieved_docs = retriever.invoke(question)
formatted_context = combine_docs(retrieved_docs)
end = time.time()
print(f""Time used for retrieving: {end - start}"")

start = time.time()
answer = ollama_llm(question, formatted_context)
end = time.time()
print(f""Time used for LLM: {end - start}"")

I found when my chromaDB size just about 1.4M, it takes more than 20 seconds for retrieving and still only takes about 3 or 4 seconds for LLM. Is there anything I missing? or RAG tech itself is so slow?
","
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models are slower as compared to Large Language Models (LLMs) due to an extra retrieval step.
Since RAG models search a database for relevant information, which can be time-consuming, especially with large databases, it is tend to be slower. Versus LLMs respond faster as they rely on pre-trained information and skip the said database retrieval step.
You must also note that LLMs may lack the most current or specific information compared to RAG models, which usually access external data sources and can provide more detailed responses using the latest information.
Thus, Despite being slower, RAG models have the advantage in response quality and relevance for complex, information-rich queries. Hope I am able to help.

Please mark this as a answer, if you think this sets a perfect context for your case.

Note the original codes in that notebook work perfectly (training, evaluation, etc). I just got this error because I tried to inspect the dataset, try to save the generated dataset, etc. to explore the dataset object...
Shouldn't the dataset structure be accessible in a similar way after with_transform() or set_transform()? Why does it call the transform function again if we just attempt to access one of the features?
I’m hoping you can shed some light on this behaviour...
","This is not the way how you pick up the dataset items. First you need to indicate the slice:
prepared_ds_batch = prepared_ds['train'][0:10]

by using indexing.
Then you can use the key labels
prepared_ds_batch['labels']
[out]: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Regarding the second issue with saving the data: you are not able to save it because of the known issue with transform functions: https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/issues/6221
You might however save the dataset as prepared_ds.with_format(None).save_to_disk('test_path'). But after loading it again from disk you need to launch again the transform function.
Edited: You cannot use prepared_ds['train']['labels'] as 'labels' is expected to be integers representing indices of the items.

prompt command that works in bash pipe,"I'm looking for a prompt command that will allow you to use readline bindings in the middle of a bash pipe, like so:
$ prompt -i 'prefill' -p 'prompt> ' | cat

And I get to edit with readline bindings with text prefilled like this:
prompt> prefill|

And then the output of whatever you typed is sent to cat.
I have written a python program that does almost all of this:
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

def input_with_prefill(prompt, text):
    def hook():
        readline.insert_text(text)
        readline.redisplay()
    readline.set_pre_input_hook(hook)
    result = input(prompt)
    readline.set_pre_input_hook()
    return result

def arg(flag):
    arg = """"
    if flag in sys.argv:
        tuple_matches_flag = lambda x: x[1] == flag
        # select first instance of ""<flag>"", 
        arg_ind = next(filter(tuple_matches_flag, enumerate(sys.argv)))[0]
        # add one to the index for the value of the arg
        arg = sys.argv[arg_ind + 1]
    return arg

def main():
    prompt = arg(""-p"")
    prefill = arg(""-i"")
    response = input_with_prefill(prompt, prefill)
    print(response)

main()

This works great for when it's used on its own. prompt -i 'prefill' -p 'prompt> ' works perfectly how I want it to.
However, when I put it in a pipe like this prompt -i 'prefill' -p 'prompt> ' | cat it won't work. I understand that is because the prompt is sending it's stdout to the FIFO pipe to cat, so the readline library can't work correctly because it usually interfaces with stdout. So I thought that the solution would be to redirect the file desciptors like this:
prompt -i 'prefill' -p 'p> ' 3>&1 1>&2 2>&3 3>&- | cat

This will create a 3rd file descriptor, point it to where stdout used to be (the FIFO pipe to cat), points stdout to stderr (terminal), points stderr to the FIFO pipe, and closes the 3rd file descriptor. So, at the end of this we have prompt's stderr going to the FIFO, and prompt's stdout going to the console. If we tweak the python program's last line to print(response, file=sys.stderr), then this should work. But, it doesn't. There are 2 prompts printed, and no prefill. What is wrong?

how to stream from a server action,"I use Next.js server actions instead of API routes to make a request to OpenAI:
lib/gpt.ts:
export async function getAISuggestion(session: Session) {
  const prompt = ...

  const { stream, handlers } = LangChainStream();

  chatModel.predictMessages(prompt, {callbacks: [handlers]});

  return stream;
}

The server action calls it:
actions.ts:
export async function getSuggestion(): Promise<
  ServerActionResponse<ReadableStream<Uint8Array>>
> {
  try {
    [...]

    const stream = await GPT.getAISuggestion(session);
    
    return { data: stream };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    [...]
  }
}

I'm trying to call this server action from a client component:
ClientComponent.tsx:
""use client"";

[...]

function foo {
    [...]

    const { data, error } = await getSugestion();
    
    if (data) {
      const reader = data.getReader(); 
      const decoder = new TextDecoder();
      let done = false;
      let text ="""";

        setAiSuggestionsText(text);
      }
    } else {

But apparently, you can't send a stream from a server action to a client component:

Warning: Only plain objects can be passed to Client Components from Server Components. ReadableStream objects are not supported.

recalling data user has input and showing if it is a number,"This is a two part question, I currently have the below code and I'm trying to have it so that the console will tell me if it is a lower case letter or an upper case letter or of it is a number. I cant seem to get the number.isInteger to work so please tell me where I am going wrong with that.
Also I would like to have it so that there is a call back of what the user entered. So instead of it just saying ""This is a upper case letter"" I would like it to state ""The letter g you entered is lowercase"" and vice versa for upperCase and numbers.
Hope that makes sense, please find below my current code. I am new to coding and javascript so please try dumb it down as much as possible for me. Thanks!

gpt2 model from hugging face always generate same result,"Why were all the results I got from the GPT-2 model the same no matter what I fed into it?
The following are my operating details.
First I download the needed files from the official website. These files included config.json, merges.txt, pytorch_model.bin, tokenizer.json, tokenizer_config.json and vocab.json. Then I stored them in the root path of the project ./gpt2.
Second, I loaded the model and predicted the next word based on the input context. The code is displayed as follows.

model = GPT2Model.from_pretained('./gpt2') 
gpt_tokenizer=GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('./gpt2')

idx_next=torch.argmax(output,dim=-1,keepdim=True) 
ids=idx_next.squeeze(0) 
text=gpt_tokenizer.decode(ids.tolist()) 
print(text) 

Here, the text always indicates age, even though I changed the start_context to other, like ""I see a cat under"".
I hope someone can tell me the reason and help me work it out, thanks.
","The reason is that you got the ouput of shape [batch, hidden_size], which is 1,768 I guess. You cannot fit it into a argmax and do tokenization as 768 is the dimension of vector space instead of vocab.
Try using GPT2LMHeadModel:
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel
import os
os.environ[""CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES""] = ""2""
import torch

# Model and tokenizer paths
model_path = ""/mnt/sda/agent_mxz/models/gpt2""
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_path)

# Input texts
texts = [""Replace me by any text you'd like."", ""Hello, this is"", ""Write a story for me.""]

# Ensure padding is done on the left
tokenizer.padding_side = ""left""

# Define PAD Token = EOS Token
tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token
model.config.pad_token_id = model.config.eos_token_id
model.config.do_sample = False

# Tokenize the inputs with padding
encoded_inputs = tokenizer(texts, return_tensors='pt', padding=True, truncation=True)
print(encoded_inputs)
# Get model output
outputs = model(**encoded_inputs)
# outputs1 = model.generate()
# Print the outputs

The model you use will vary depending on your hardware. For good
results, you should have at least 10GB VRAM at a minimum for the 7B

In order to lower the memory footprint of the model, I first recommend that you try running the model in half precision (if supported) with a batch size of one. If you still experience CUDA out of memory I suggest you to try with a quantized version of the model, like for example these ones.

how does openaiembeddings work is it creating a single vector of size 1536 for whole text corpus,"I'm working with the OpenAIEmbeddings() class from OpenAI, which uses the text-embedding-3-small model. According to the documentation, it generates a 1536-dimensional vector for any input text.
However, I'm a bit confused about how this works:

Is the 1536-dimensional vector generated for the entire input text?
If the 1536-dimensional vector represents the entire input text, how does the model handle individual words versus longer texts like sentences or paragraphs?

I was expecting this:
If there are 100 words in my input text, i expected that OpenAIEmbeddings() would output 100 vectors, each having size 1536.
But the output is a single vector of size 1536 for the whole input text.
Why I expected this?
Because in my learning, i've understood that embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe provide vectors for each word in a corpus. How does this differ from the approach taken by OpenAIEmbeddings?
I'm trying to understand whether there's a way to extract embeddings for individual words using this model or if the output is always a single vector representing the whole input.
Any insights or examples would be greatly appreciated!
","Everything you described is 100% expected.
Q: Is the 1536-dimensional vector generated for the entire input text?
A: Yes.
Q: If the 1536-dimensional vector represents the entire input text, how does the model handle individual words versus longer texts like sentences or paragraphs?
A: First, the OpenAI Embeddings model doesn't handle a single word any different than a long text. For the model, it's an input. The input can be even a single character (e.g., ""a""), but it doesn't make sense to calculate an embedding vector out of it since ""a"" doesn't semantically mean anything to us humans.
Second, what you probably meant with this question is what happens when you do a similarity search with these embeddings. In other words, what happens when you use them? What happens if you use embeddings of words, sentences, paragraphs, or the whole text? Does it matter? Yes!
This is called chunking. The decision about how to chunk your text depends on the use case. The best thing is probably to simply try and see. If you get meaningful results after doing a similarity search, then this means that chunking is appropriate (even if this means chunking the whole text). If you don't get meaningful results after doing a similarity search, then this means that chunking isn't appropriate (e.g., instead of chunking by paragraph, try chunking by sentences).
There's an excellent Stack Overflow blog post about this topic you should read (pay attention to the bolded text because this is the best explanation):

With RAG, you create text embeddings of the pieces of data that you
want to draw from and retrieve. That allows you to place a piece of
the source text within the semantic space that LLMs use to create
responses.
/.../
When it comes to RAG systems, you’ll need to pay special attention to
how big the individual pieces of data are. How you divide your data up
is called chunking, and it’s more complex than embedding whole
documents.
/.../
The size of the chunked data is going to make a huge difference in
what information comes up in a search. When you embed a piece of data,
the whole thing is converted into a vector. Include too much in a
chunk and the vector loses the ability to be specific to anything it
discusses. Include too little and you lose the context of the data.

","You are asking it to return a JSON object in you prompt, ""Return the result as a JSON object."" that it why! If you give it the same prompt using the website, you will notice that the response is nicely formatted, that is because of those ""```json ...content ```"" markdown formatting.
You can solve it using two methods:

Explicitly replace ""```json"" and ""```"" with empty string:

import json

# For example, this is the content in response:
response = '```json{""color_theme"": ""Mint Green and Black"",""font_style"": ""Sans-serif"",""short_description"": ""Web Publishing Platform"",""category"": ""hero""}```'

# Replace and assign back to original content
response = response.replace(""```json"", """")
response = response.replace(""```"", """")

# Don't forget to convert to JSON as it is a string right now:
json_result = json.loads(response)


Using slicing:

import json

# For example, this is the content in response:
response = '```json{""color_theme"": ""Mint Green and Black"",""font_style"": ""Sans-serif"",""short_description"": ""Web Publishing Platform"",""category"": ""hero""}```'

# ""```json"" is 7 character long, but slicing count start from 0. ""{"" is at 7th character.
# ""```"" is 3 character long (at the end).
response = response[7:-3]

# Don't forget to convert to JSON as it is a string right now:
json_result = json.loads(response)


And for writing to the .txt file, you can use json.dump() as follows:
import json

response = '```json{""color_theme"": ""Mint Green and Black"",""font_style"": ""Sans-serif"",""short_description"": ""Web Publishing Platform"",""category"": ""hero""}```'

response = response[7:-3]
response = json.loads(response)

langchain workaround for with_structured_output using chatbedrock,"I'm working with the langchain library to implement a document analysis application.  Especifically I want to use the routing technique described in this documentation. i wanted to follow along the example, but my environment is restricted to AWS, and I am using ChatBedrock instead of ChatOpenAI due to limitations with my deployment.
According to this overview the with_structured_output method, which I need, is not (yet) implemented for models on AWS Bedrock, which is why I am looking for a workaround or any method to replicate this functionality.
The key functionality I am looking for is shown in this example:
from typing import List
from typing import Literal

from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI



class RouteQuery(BaseModel):
    """"""Route a user query to the most relevant datasource.""""""

    datasources: List[Literal[""python_docs"", ""js_docs"", ""golang_docs""]] = Field(
        ...,
        description=""Given a user question choose which datasources would be most relevant for answering their question"",
    )

system = """"""You are an expert at routing a user question to the appropriate data source.

Based on the programming language the question is referring to, route it to the relevant data source.""""""
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        (""system"", system),
        (""human"", ""{question}""),
    ]
)

llm = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-3.5-turbo-0125"", temperature=0)
structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(RouteQuery)
router = prompt | structured_llm
router.invoke(
    {
        ""question"": ""is there feature parity between the Python and JS implementations of OpenAI chat models""
    }
)

The output would be:
RouteQuery(datasources=['python_docs', 'js_docs'])

The most important fact for me is that it just selects items from the list without any additional overhead, which makes it possible to setup the right follow up questions.
Did anyone find a workaround how to resolve this issue?
","I found a solution in these two blog posts: here and here.
The key is to use the instructor package, which is a wrapper around pydantic. This means langchain is not necessary.

how to prompt an sql query user to input information,"I have a query that I wrote in SQL server that will be run mainly by people who don't know SQL, and there are two areas that have to have a different string or date entered each time the query is run. As of right now, I just wrote it so that you enter the information at the top of the query and its stored as a variable. Is there a way that I can get SQL to prompt the person running the query to enter the data? below is an excerpt of the code that has what I am talking about in it.
declare 
/*ENTER ACCOUNTING MONTH*/     
   @amon VARCHAR(2) = '05',
/*ENTER INVOICE DATE IN MM/DD/YYYY FORMAT*/
   @invdate DATE = '05/31/2015'
~~

~~
declare @sumA numeric(25, 5), @sumB numeric(25, 5), @ratio numeric(25, 5)
select @sumA = sum(amnt) from accnt where accno = '1152'
select @sumB = sum(amnt) from acc1152
update acc1152 set amnt = amnt * (@sumA/@sumB),
amon = @amon,
invdate = @invdate,
ven = '1152',
code = '1152',
invno = 'INVENTORY'

so is it possible for SQL to prompt the user to type in the value for @amon and @invdate? other than me just having the comment line telling them to do so?
","In case you can not do an application, you have no developers etc etc, you have one way - make a stored proc:
create stored procedure spDoSomeJob
@amon VARCHAR(2),
@invdate DATE
as
begin

    ~~
    rest of the code
    ~~
    declare @sumA numeric(25, 5), @sumB numeric(25, 5), @ratio numeric(25, 5)
    select @sumA = sum(amnt) from accnt where accno = '1152'
    select @sumB = sum(amnt) from acc1152
    update acc1152 set amnt = amnt * (@sumA/@sumB),
    amon = @amon,
    invdate = @invdate,
    ven = '1152',
    code = '1152',
    invno = 'INVENTORY'

end

Deny any activity permissions for users except just running this procedure. Execute it like:
exec spDoSomeJob  @amon = '05', @invdate = '05/31/2015'

At least you will be sure that no user can occasionally corrupt something... And if you will not supply values to parameters of stored procedure it will prompt you to do this unless you have no default values for those parameters. It seems to me like the best workaround for your case.

issue with llama 27b model producing output limited to 511 tokens,"I am facing an issue with the Llama 2-7B model where the output is consistently limited to only 511 tokens, even though the model should theoretically be capable of producing outputs up to a maximum of 4096 tokens.
I’ve tried setting the max_tokens parameter to higher values, such as 3000, and have calculated the available tokens by subtracting the prompt tokens from the model’s total token limit (4096 tokens). However, despite these adjustments, I continue to receive outputs capped at 511 tokens.

Actual Output: The output is capped at 511 tokens, regardless of the prompt length.

Tried:

Setting max_tokens to 3000 or higher.
Calculating the available tokens by subtracting the prompt length from the model’s total token limit.

I would expect the model to generate responses that are close to the token limit (ideally closer to 3000 tokens or more, depending on the input), but it keeps producing output limited to 511 tokens.

","This should match your initial text example; add it to ~/.zshrc:
setopt prompt_subst
PROMPT='\$ /$(printf ""%.1s/"" ${(s./.)PWD:h})${PWD:t} '


(s./.) - splits a path at /.
printf ""%.1s/"" - prints the first character of each directory piece.
${PWD:h} - the 'head' of the current directory, i.e. everything but the last element.
${PWD:t} - the tail / last element in the directory path.

Adding colors and other characters is a bit more involved.  When building a  complicated prompt, it's often easier to use a precmd; some of the many posts that discuss prompt colors and precmds are here, here, and here.

Edited to add:
As @rowboat noted, the code above will include an extra / in top-level directories like /tmp. This is due to printf always including at least one result even when there are zero parent directories. One fix is a substitution to convert double // to /:
PROMPT='\$ ${${:-$(printf ""/%.1s"" ${(s./.)PWD:h})/${PWD:t}}/\/\///} '

Similarly, another substitution can be added to escape % as %%, if you need to handle directory names that start with a percent sign:
PROMPT='\$ ${${${:-$(printf ""/%.1s"" ${(s./.)PWD:h})/${PWD:t}}/\/\///}//\%/%%} '

langchain  local llama compatible model,"I'm trying to setup a local chatbot demo for testing purpose. I wanted to use LangChain as the framework and LLAMA as the model. Tutorials I found all involve some registration, API key, HuggingFace, etc, which seems unnecessary for my purpose.
Is there a way to use a local LLAMA comaptible model file just for testing purpose? And also an example code to use the model with LangChain would be appreciated. Thanks!
UPDATE: I wrote a blog post based on the accepted answer.
","No registration is required to utilize on-prem local models within ecosystems like Hugging Face (HF). Similarly, using Langchain does not involve any registration requirements. Various model formats, such as GGUF and GGML, are employed for storing models for inference and can be found on HF. It is crucial to consider these formats when attempting to load and run a model locally.
For instance, consider TheBloke's Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGUF model, which is a relatively compact 7-billion-parameter model suitable for execution on a modern CPU/GPU. To run the model, we can use Llama.cpp from Langchain:
def llamacpp():
    from langchain_community.llms import LlamaCpp
    from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
    from langchain.chains import LLMChain
    
    llm = LlamaCpp(

        verbose=True,
    )
    
    template = """"""Question: {question}

    prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=[""question""])
    
    llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)
    question = ""Who is Bjarne Stroustrup and how is he related to programming?""
    print(llm_chain.run(question))

And get output from the LLM:


Bjarne Stroustrup is a Danish computer scientist who created C++.
- He was born in Aarhus, Denmark on August 5, 1950 and earned his PhD from Cambridge University in 1983.
- In 1979 he began developing the programming language C++, which was initially called ""C with Classes"".
- C++ was first released in 1983 and has since become one of the most popular programming languages in use today.

Bjarne Stroustrup is known for his work on the C programming
language and its extension to C++.
- He wrote The C Programming Language, a book that helped establish C as a widely used language.
- He also wrote The Design and Evolution of C++, a detailed explanation of how he created C++ and why he made certain design
choices.


...

In this instance, I cloned TheBloke's model repository from HF and positioned it in a directory named models/. The final path for the model became models/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGUF/llama-2-7b-chat.Q4_0.gguf:
# Make sure you have git-lfs installed (https://git-lfs.com)
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGUF

Although the model can be run on a CPU, this was locally run on my Windows PC equipped with an RTX 4070 card with good performance during inference.

","Your question is very broad as there are always a million ways to design something, but I'll give you the five-minute answer.

Use a data structure to hold your question / answer combinations, like an array of objects. An array makes sense if you want to keep the user along a ""path"". You simply iterate through the array to ask questions.
var questions = [{ 
        question: 'Are you happy?',
        answer: 'yes',
        affirm: 'Yay! You got it right!',
        rebuttal: 'Nope, you are definitely happy.'
    },
    {
        question: 'Are you mad?',
        answer: 'no',
        affirm: 'Good job!',
        rebuttal: 'Not right.'
    }];

for (var i = 0, l = questions.length; i < l; i++) {
    answer = prompt(questions[i].question);

    // I do not support manipulating a loop counter mid-loop, but it's for an example.
    if (answer !== questions[i].answer) {
        alert(questions[i].rebuttal);
        i--;
    } else {
        alert(questions[i].affirm);
    }
}

With your method, which I have to be honest, is pretty primitive, you'd use have to write the choices in the text of the prompt. For multiple answers, you'd have to force the user to delimit their answers somehow (with commas, for example). But honestly, I would abandon the prompt/alert method altogether, and use HTML  elements to achieve your goals (assuming this is in a web browser).
It seems other users have addressed your syntax errors.

If many of these concepts are foreign to you, I recommend studying up at Codecademy, as they have excellent courses on Javascript and HTML.

how to override a fish_prompt function from a omf theme,"I lost some time on it so I'm creating this Q&A.
I'm using an omf theme and I would like to make a change in the theme prompt. Unfortunately, the change I want to do is not possible by setting the theme config variables.
I tried to edit fish_prompt function using funced fish_prompt; funcsave fish_prompt but if I do so the theme is not loaded anymore so I can't use the functions defined within the theme. The same happens if I just create a fish_prompt function in my config.fish.
","tldr
add these lines before you define your own fish_prompt function
source $OMF_PATH/init.fish

# Read current theme
test -f $OMF_CONFIG/theme
  and read -l theme < $OMF_CONFIG/theme
  or set -l theme default

set -l theme_functions_path {$OMF_CONFIG,$OMF_PATH}/themes*/$theme/functions/
for conf in $theme_functions_path/*.fish
  source $conf
end

explanation
When omf is loaded, it add the theme functions files to the $fish_function_path. (source code)
According to fish documentation

When fish needs to load a function, it searches through any directories in the list variable $fish_function_path for a file with a name consisting of the name of the function plus the suffix .fish and loads the first it finds.

What the documentation doesn't explicitly say is if the function is already defined (in config.fish, for example) it will not try to load from $fish_function_path.
So the issue is, when you creates your own fish_prompt function, it shadows the .../<theme>/functions/fish_prompt.fish.
What you need to do to work around it is force loading the theme function file before you redefine it.
For example:
# Read current theme
test -f $OMF_CONFIG/theme
  and read -l theme < $OMF_CONFIG/theme
  or set -l theme default

set -l theme_functions_path {$OMF_CONFIG,$OMF_PATH}/themes*/$theme/functions/fish_prompt.fish
for conf in $theme_functions_path
  source $conf
end

function fish_prompt
  # prompt_theme_foo
  # prompt_theme_bar
end

Be sure to run it after omf init.fish is loaded.
You can assure by sourcing omf manually source $OMF_PATH/init.fish or be sure omf.fish is in an alphabetical order lesser than your file.

How to resolve this issue?

Supplementary：

cargo rustc failed with code 101
'ChatGLMTokenizer' object has no attribute 'sp_tokenizer'

I have tried some methods from the two links above, but none of them have solved my problem.

The rustc 1.72.1 version is too low, package clap_lex v0.7.2 cannot be built because it requires rustc 1.74 or newer.
transformers==4.34.0 no longer needs to install the Rust compiler, but the error occurs: AttributeError: 'ChatGLMTokenizer' object has no attribute 'sp_tokenizer'.
transformers==4.33.2 requires the installation of the Rust compiler, and the error is: cargo rustc --lib --message-format=json-render-diagnostics --manifest-path Cargo.toml --release -v --features pyo3/extension-module --crate-type cdylib -- -C 'link-args=-undefined dynamic_lookup -Wl,-install_name,@rpath/tokenizers.cpython-312-darwin.so' failed with code 101.

","ChatGPT suggested

You can try using Python 3.10 or 3.11 to see if the issue is resolved

Since my Python version was 3.12.5, I downgraded to 3.11.9 and re-ran pip install. This successfully resolved the problem.
I've noticed that Gemini 1.5 Flash only suggests me to update Rust and Cargo, while GPT-4o mini additionally mentions the issue of Python version. I have been using Gemini before, it seems I should compare these two models more in the future.

removing strangespecial characters from outputs llama 31 model,"Background: I'm using Hugging Face's transformers package and Llama 3.1 8B (Instruct).
Problem: I am generating responses to a prompt one word at a time in the following way (note that I choose over texts and append that to the input_string, then repeat the process):
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path, use_safetensors=True)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_path, use_safetensors=True)

input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_string, return_tensors=""pt"") # tokenize to ids
logits = model(input_ids).logits # call model() to get logits
logits = logits[-1, -1] # only care about the last projection in the last batch
probs = torch.nn.functional.softmax(logits, dim=-1) # softmax() to get probabilities
probs, ids = torch.topk(probs, 5) # keep only the top 5
texts = tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(ids) # convert ids to tokens

But I notice many strange or special characters appearing in the output. For example, the following is the literal string returned from input_string = ""How often should I wear a seatbelt?"":
ĠAlways.ĊĊĊÄÃĦAlways,ĠunlessĠyouĠareÄłinÃĦaÃĦcarÃĥthatÃĦisÃĦnotÃĦmoving.

Is there any way to easily remove strange special characters?
I've tried using options on the decoder (in every possible T/F combo), such as the following:
myStr = 'ĠAlways.ĊĊĊÄÃĦAlways,ĠunlessĠyouĠareÄłinÃĦaÃĦcarÃĥthatÃĦisÃĦnotÃĦmoving.'
tokenizer.decode(tokenizer.encode(myStr), skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=True)

But it doesn't remove any of the special characters from the string.
","TL;DR
Use this instead of rolling out your own detokenizer.
tokenizer.batch_decode(input_ids)

In Long
The official Llama 3.1 has some approval process that might take some time, so this answer will use a proxy model that shares the same tokenizer as llama 3.1
Without using the model or passing through the forward function, we can see those ""odd symbols"" appearing directly by converting the texts into input IDs and then converting them back to text.
You'll see that consistently there's this Ġ symbol added.
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
import torch

model_path = ""neuralmagic/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct-FP8""
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path, use_safetensors=True)

input_string = ""Always. Always, unless you are in a car that is not moving""
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_string, return_tensors=""pt"") # tokenize to ids
texts = tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(input_ids.squeeze()) # convert ids to tokens

print(texts)

[out]:
['<|begin_of_text|>',
 'Always',
 '.',
 'ĠAlways',
 ',',
 'Ġunless',
 'Ġyou',
 'Ġare',
 'Ġin',
 'Ġa',
 'Ġcar',
 'Ġthat',
 'Ġis',
 'Ġnot',
 'Ġmoving']

It seems like Ġ is denoting spaces. Like how sentencepiece uses the ""▁"" (U+2581) symbol.
So where does that Ġ come from?
Lets first try printing out the vocab, and you'll see these non-natural text characters appearing everywhere:
print(tokenizer.vocab)

[out]:

 'ĠCarly': 79191,
 'ĠBOT': 83430,

 'Ġhp': 21280,
 '(Module': 76395,
 'ãģ¾ãģ§': 103296,

Stop telling me the obvious, just let me know here those ĠÑĢÐÙģÙĤ characters come from...
See https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/issues/80 and https://augustasmacijauskas.github.io/personal-website/posts/tokenizers-deep-dive/tokenizers-deep-dive.html
The root of this Ġevil comes from https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/blob/master/src/encoder.py#L9
So how do I get the decoded tokens in natural text?
Try this:
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
import torch

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path, use_safetensors=True)

input_string = ""Always. Always, unless you are in a car that is not moving""
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_string, return_tensors=""pt"") # tokenize to ids
texts = tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(input_ids.squeeze()) 

tokenizer.batch_decode(input_ids) # convert ids to natural text.

[out]:
['<|begin_of_text|>Always. Always, unless you are in a car that is not moving']

And to remove the special BOS token,
tokenizer.batch_decode(input_ids, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=True)

[out]:
['Always. Always, unless you are in a car that is not moving']

For filenames etc., I've created a variable used everywhere:

I replaced imports with:
from transformers import (AutoConfig, AutoModel, AutoTokenizer)
#from transformers import (BertConfig, BertForSequenceClassification, BertTokenizer,)

As suggested in Transformers Documentation - Auto Classes.

Instantiating one of AutoConfig, AutoModel, and AutoTokenizer will directly create a class of the relevant architecture.

When instantiating AutoModel, you must specify a model_type parameter in ./MRPC/config.json file (downloaded during Notebook runtime).

Code that appends model_type to config.json, in the same format:

    json_decoded = json.load(json_file)

The group chat works fine up until SQL_Runner returns the data from DB. But when the next speaker is expected to be the Result_Validator, the SQL_Generator is assigned as next speaker, although I explicitly state in the system message that SQL_Runner should pass the result to Result_Validator.

For some reason, SQL_Generator agent's role remains as tool following the activity of SQL_Runner instead of one of [system, user, assistant] and it leads to this error:

how to use wasm tiktoken in react webpack js,"The build issues due to wasm instantiate or wasm not being imported.
wasm.__wbindgen_add_to_stack_pointer is not a function
","To use tiktoken wasm in react for better performance, follow this for webpack 5.
In webpack config override add the following. You can directly use wasm from js cdn as well. Skip this step if you want to use cdn:
module.exports = (config, env) => {

  config.experiments = {
    asyncWebAssembly: true,
    layers: true,
  };

}

To use tiktoken with config override:
import { get_encoding, init } from 'tiktoken/init';
import wasm from 'tiktoken/tiktoken_bg.wasm';

  let tikInit = false;
  const countTokens= (str) =>{
    if (!tikInit) {
    tikInit = true;

      const wasmFile = await fetch(wasm);
      const buffer = await wasmFile.arrayBuffer();
      await init((imports) => WebAssembly.instantiate(buffer, imports));
    }

    const e = get_encoding('cl100k_base');
    const t = e.encode(str);
    e.free();
    return t.length;
  }

To use tiktoken with js cdn for wasm and without config override:
import { get_encoding, init } from 'tiktoken/init';
import wasm from 'tiktoken/tiktoken_bg.wasm';

  let tikInit = false;
  const countTokens= (str) =>{
    if (!tikInit) {
    tikInit = true;
}
   const wasmFile = await fetch(
      'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tiktoken@1.0.15/tiktoken_bg.wasm'
    );
 
      const buffer = await wasmFile.arrayBuffer();
      await init((imports) => WebAssembly.instantiate(buffer, imports));
    }

    const e = get_encoding('cl100k_base');
    const t = e.encode(str);
    e.free();
    return t.length;

Python code must compares the html tags in RO with the html tags in EN and displays in Output the unique tags in both files, taking into account that most of the tags in RO have their corresponding translation in the tags in EN. But the idea of ​​the code is that the code also finds those html tags in RO that were omitted from being translated into EN.
Here's how I came up with the solution in Python code. I followed a simple calculation.
First method:
First, you have to count all the tags in ro, then all the tags in en.
Then you have to memorize each type of tag in ro, but then also in en.
Then you have to count the words in each tag in ro and the words in each tag in en.
Don't forget that there can be 2 identical tags, but on different lines, just like in RO.
Then you have to statistically calculate the result. How much are the tags in ro minus the tags in en?
The second method, to verify the output, is to print the screen. Compare the entire ro part and the entire en part separately through OCR, then line by line, see which tags in ro are plus compared to the tags in en

","SECOND, and the BEST SOLUTION.
Finally I solved the problem, but not with ChatGPT or Claude. No other AI could find the solution, because it didn't know how to think about the solution.
In fact, to find the solution to this problem, you had to assign some identifiers to each tag, and do multiple searches.
ChatGPT or Claude, or other AIs, will have to seriously consider this type of solution for such problems.
Here are the specifications, the way I thought about solving the problem. It's a different way of thinking about doing PARSINGS.

RuntimeError: CUDA error: device-side assert triggered
CUDA kernel errors might be asynchronously reported at some other API call, so the stacktrace below might be incorrect.
For debugging consider passing CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1.
Compile with `TORCH_USE_CUDA_DSA` to enable device-side assertions.

The entire problem arised only after adding top-p sampling.
I expected my sampling to work, as I have looked through my code maybe 30 times already. ChatGPT says this code is perfect, and that my error is really hard to debug. My hypothesis is that values are getting incorrectly filtered or setting them to ""bad"" values.
","The problem is the indexing you're doing at this line:
logits[sorted_indices[~sorted_indices_to_keep]] = float('-inf')
For reasons I'll explain, this is causing an index out of bounds error. Out of bounds indexing is a common cause of CUDA error: device-side assert triggered errors.
Consider the following:
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

torch.manual_seed(42)

top_p = 0.2

logits = torch.randn(8, 128) # random logits

# sort logits 
sorted_logits, sorted_indices = torch.sort(logits, descending=True)

# calculate cumulative probs
cumulative_probs = torch.cumsum(torch.nn.functional.softmax(sorted_logits, dim=-1), dim=-1)

# apply top p threshold to cumulative probs
sorted_indices_to_keep = cumulative_probs <= top_p

# ensure at least one index is kept
sorted_indices_to_keep[..., 0] = True

# this is the problem: logits[sorted_indices[~sorted_indices_to_keep]] = float('-inf')
print(logits.shape, sorted_indices[~sorted_indices_to_keep].shape)
> torch.Size([8, 128]) torch.Size([989])

When you index sorted_indices[~sorted_indices_to_keep], both inputs are of shape (8, 128), but the output is of shape (989,) (or similar depending on the random seed for the dummy logits).
This happens because the sorted_indices_to_keep has an irregular number of True values in each row. This means the indexing operation can't resolve the output into a clean 2D tensor where every row is the same size. Pytorch handles this situation by returning an unrolled vector of every True value from the indexing tensor.
This means when you try to compute logits[sorted_indices[~sorted_indices_to_keep]], you are using a long 1D tensor to index into a small 2D tensor. If you run this on CPU, you get an error like IndexError: index 20 is out of bounds for dimension 0 with size 8. When you run on GPU, you get the Cuda assert error.
To fix this, use the scatter operation. Use something like this:
def top_p_filtering(logits, top_p, shift_indices=True, debug=False):
    """"""Filter the logits using top-p (nucleus) sampling.""""""
    # Sort logits in descending order and get the sorted indices
    sorted_logits, sorted_indices = torch.sort(logits, descending=True)

    # Compute the cumulative probabilities of the sorted logits
    cumulative_probs = torch.cumsum(torch.nn.functional.softmax(sorted_logits, dim=-1), dim=-1)

    # Create a mask for the tokens to keep
    sorted_indices_to_keep = cumulative_probs <= top_p
    
    # Optional: shift indices to the right. This results in keeping the first 
    # token above the top_p threshold. Skip this line to ensure that all 
    # token probs are strictly below the top_p threshold
    if shift_indices:
        sorted_indices_to_keep[..., 1:] = sorted_indices_to_keep[..., :-1].clone()

    # Ensure that at least one token is kept (the first token, which has the highest logit)
    sorted_indices_to_keep[..., 0] = True
    
    # Use scatter to create top_p mask
    mask = sorted_indices_to_keep.scatter(dim=1, index=sorted_indices, src=sorted_indices_to_keep)
    
    # Optional debug check to make sure top_p is being honored
    # Note we need to compute probs before masking because applying softmax 
    # after masking will result in a distribution that sums to 1
    if debug:
        probs = torch.nn.functional.softmax(logits, dim=-1)
        probs[~mask] = 0
        print(probs.sum(-1))
    
    # Use mask to set logit vals to -inf
    logits[~mask] = float('-inf')

ollama with python  chat is stuck on the first prompt,"I'm testing a local GPT with Ollama running on a Flask server. I've developed an interface to chat using Llama3.2 model.

User: table
system: I'll let you know if each word represents an animal. - horse: Yes, it's an animal. - elephant: Yes, it's an animal. - table: No, it's not an animal. (it's a piece of furniture)
User: bottle
system: Let's get started with the game. Here are my answers: 1. horse - Yes, it's an animal. 2. elephant - Yes, it's an animal. 3. table - No, it's not an animal. 4. bottle - No, it's not an animal. Did I get them right?
User: dolphin
system: Here are my answers: - No (it's a piece of furniture) - Yes - No (it's an inanimate object) - No (it's an inanimate object, a container) - Yes
User: ok stop the game, let's do something else
system: Here are my responses: * horse: yes * elephant: yes * table: no * bottle: no * dolphin: yes

The thing is, when I try the same thing directly on cmd (ollama run llama3.2) it behaves as expected:

-> We are gonna play a game in whic I'm gonna say some words and you have to tell me if the word represents an animal.I just want you to tell me if the word I'm saying is an animal or not

Yes.

Yes.

No.

No.

This is the code where the model is initialized and then called:
model_path = ""Llama-2-7b-hf""
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_path, return_dict_in_generate=True, local_files_only=True).to(device)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(engine, local_files_only=True)

input_ids = tokenizer(model_path, return_tensors=""pt"").input_ids.to(device)
outputs = model.generate(input_ids, top_k=1, max_length=max_len, num_return_sequences=1, output_scores=True)
sequences, scores = outputs.sequences, outputs.scores

I have used this code with several other models like Mistral and Occiglot and they return ModelOutput objects with these attributes, sequences and scores, but not Llama. Can anyone help me understand what is wrong?
","I managed to solve it by passing the return_dict_in_generate and output_scores parameters in the call to model.generate instead of in the initialization of the model.
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(engine, local_files_only=True).to(device)
outputs = model.generate(input_ids, top_k=1, max_length=max_len, num_return_sequences=1, output_scores=True, return_dict_in_generate=True)

how to use windbg for opening a dump and launching some windbg commands from the command prompt,"As mentioned in this other question, I'd like to start Windbg, open a dump, and launch some commands (.load pykd.pyd and !py heap_stat.py).

i get an empty array from vector serch in mongodb with langchain,"I have the code:
loader = PyPDFLoader(“https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08774.pdf”)
data = loader.load()
docs = text_splitter1.split_documents(data)
vector_search_index = “vector_index”

vector_search = MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch.from_documents(
  documents=docs,
  embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings(disallowed_special=()),
  collection=atlas_collection,
  index_name=vector_search_index,
)

query = ""What were the compute requirements for training GPT 4""
results = vector_search1.similarity_search(query)
print(""result: "", results)

And in results I have every time only empty array. I don't understand what I do wrong. This is the link  on the langchain documentation with examples. Information is saved normally in database, but I cannot search info in this collection.
","So I was able to get this to work in MongoDB with the following code:
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=150)

loader = PyPDFLoader(""https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08774.pdf"")
data = loader.load()
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(data)

DB_NAME = ""langchain_db""
COLLECTION_NAME = ""atlas_collection""
ATLAS_VECTOR_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME = ""vector_index""
MONGODB_ATLAS_CLUSTER_URI = uri = os.environ.get(""MONGO_DB_ENDPOINT"")

client = MongoClient(MONGODB_ATLAS_CLUSTER_URI)
MONGODB_COLLECTION = client[DB_NAME][COLLECTION_NAME]

vector_search = MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch.from_documents(
    documents=docs,
    embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings(disallowed_special=()),
    collection=MONGODB_COLLECTION,
    index_name=ATLAS_VECTOR_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME,
)

query = ""What were the compute requirements for training GPT 4""
results = vector_search.similarity_search(query)
print(""result: "", results)

At this point, I did get the same results that you did. Before it would work, I had to create the vector search index and I made sure it was named the same as what is specified in ATLAS_VECTOR_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME:

FWIW - It was easier for me to do in Astra DB (I tried this first, because I am a DataStax employee):
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=150)

loader = PyPDFLoader(""https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08774.pdf"")
data = loader.load()
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(data)

  token=ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN,
)

query = ""What were the compute requirements for training GPT 4""
results = vector_search.similarity_search(query)
print(""result: "", results)

Worth noting, that Astra DB will create your vector index automatically based on the dimensions of the embedding model.

how to use multiple text values using sas prompt,"I am trying to create a prompt which allows to user to enter multiple values from a list.   I have used Prompt Type as Text.

When I try and resolve the products macro no matter how many products I select in the prompt it always resolves the first product. Here it is always resolving only Loan as the resolution to the products macro.   I want all the products in that I select through prompt to come in the macro product.

","I made a prompt, ""Color"", with the six colors of the rainbow, with the settings like you describe (and ""use throughout project"").
Then I attached it to the following program:
%put _global_;

And what I see is this;
8          %LET Color0 = 4;
9          %LET Color2 = Red;
10         %LET Color3 = Yellow;

12         %LET Color1 = Blue;
13         %LET Color_count = 4;
14         %LET Color = Blue;

This is how multiple value prompts work: they put the first selection in &prompt, then put the number of selected items in &prompt0, and then put the selected items in &prompt1-&&prompt&prompt0. You can then use them in a number of ways.  You can 
%do i = 1 %to &color0.;
  %put &&color&i.;
%end;

      - messages should not contain any explicit content, even if just a few words
      - messages should not contain abusive language or offensive content, even if just a few words
      - messages should not contain any harmful content
      - if a message is a refusal, should be polite

      Bot message: ""{{ bot_response }}""

      Question: Should the message be blocked (Yes or No)?

define user ask about cooking
  ""How can I cook pasta?""
  ""How much do I have to boil pasta?""

define flow
  user ask about cooking
  bot refuse to respond about cooking


Question : How much do I have to boil pasta?
Answer : The boiling time for pasta typically depends on the type and brand of pasta you are using. Generally, most pasta needs to be boiled for about 8 to 12 minutes. It's best to check the package instructions for the specific pasta you have, as it will provide the most accurate cooking time. Additionally, you can taste the pasta a minute or two before the suggested time to ensure it reaches your desired level of doneness.
","One thing i noticed is that your self_check_input prompt content is missing with
 `User message: ""{{ user_input }}""

  Question: Should the user message be blocked (Yes or No)?
  Answer:`

So, it doesn't have this flow to block or allow the user message.

But for your task, it's an overkill.

The ftp reads commands from a standard input.

","These steps solved my issue:

Created a Virtual Environment
Moved all the code from Jupyter Notebook to a python file
Installed necessary dependencies with pip
Ran the python file

As the problem was solved by fresh installation of the dependencies, Most probably I faced the issue because of some internal dependency conflict.

how do i store my prompt input and display all of it when i input zero,"
let i = -1;
let total = 0;
let numPrompt;

do {
  numPrompt = prompt("""")
  total += parseInt(numPrompt)
  i++;
} 
  
while (numPrompt != '0');  // do-while loop 

let avg = total/i;
console.log(total)
console.log(avg)

I want user to input a number each time till they input zero which will output all their previous input, total and average.
I declare i = -1 to avoid counting the last input which is the zero.
in my code, I only manage to display the total of all my input but what I also want is all my previous inputs (prompt)printed out each row
","You can use an array, which stores a list of things:
let i = 0;
let total = 0;
let numPrompt;
let numbers = [];

do {
    numPrompt = prompt("""")
    total += parseInt(numPrompt)
    if (numPrompt != '0') {
        numbers.push(numPrompt);
        i++;
    }
} while (numPrompt != '0'); // do-while loop 

let avg = total / i;
console.log(total)
console.log(avg)
console.log(numbers);

Setting i to -1 is a bit of a workaround -- the above code starts it at 0 and checks if the inputted number is 0 before incrementing it.

I already tried pip install for 0.20.1 version of accelerate and pip install transformers[torch]

","If you're not particular about which transformers and accelerate version to tie to, then do this to use the most up-to-date version in Google Colab:
! pip install -U accelerate
! pip install -U transformers

Then the issue you are having with accelerate should auto-resolve itself.
Note:

Underspecifying pip install -U transformers instead of pip install transformers[pytorch] might be easier since that's what most of the users do and the developers of the library will make sure that the basic pip works with the common functions and class like TrainingArguments

Instead of specifying accelerate to the pip install accelerate>=0.20.1, if you have no particular need to fixed the version, automatically upgrading to the latest version might get you more stability when using the library, esp. with ""hot""/""trending"" libraries that are constantly changing (almost) daily.



If further debugging is necessary, i.e. if the above didn't work. To check your transformers and accelerate version, do this:
import accelerate

accelerate.__version__

Most probably you might have an ImportError at the first line if accelerate is not already installed when you installed transformers.
And then if the first line works and the 2nd line is not outputting a version >=0.20.1, then that is the cause of your issue.
The current versions to-date (July 2023) are:
import accelerate
import transformers

transformers.__version__, accelerate.__version__

llamacpppython not using nvidia gpu cuda,"I have been playing around with oobabooga text-generation-webui  on my Ubuntu 20.04 with my NVIDIA GTX 1060 6GB for some weeks without problems. I have been using llama2-chat models sharing memory between my RAM and NVIDIA VRAM. I installed without much problems following the intructions on its repository.
So what I want now is to use the model loader llama-cpp with its package llama-cpp-python bindings to play around with it by myself. So using the same miniconda3 environment that oobabooga text-generation-webui uses I started a jupyter notebook and I could make inferences and everything is working well BUT ONLY for CPU.
A working example bellow,
from llama_cpp import Llama

llm = Llama(model_path=""/mnt/LxData/llama.cpp/models/meta-llama2/llama-2-7b-chat/ggml-model-q4_0.bin"", 
            n_gpu_layers=32, n_threads=6, n_ctx=3584, n_batch=521, verbose=True), 

prompt = """"""[INST] <<SYS>>
Name the planets in the solar system? 
<</SYS>>
[/INST] 
""""""
output = llm(prompt, max_tokens=350, echo=True)
print(output['choices'][0]['text'].split('[/INST]')[-1])


Of course! Here are the eight planets in our solar system, listed in order from closest to farthest from the Sun:

Mercury
Venus
Earth
Mars
Jupiter
Saturn
Uranus
Neptune



Note that Pluto was previously considered a planet but is now classified as a dwarf planet due to its small size and unique orbit.

I want to make inference using GPU as well. What is wrong?
Why can't I offload to gpu like the parameter n_gpu_layers=32 specifies and also like oobabooga text-generation-webui already does on the same miniconda environment whithout any problems?
","After searching around and suffering quite for 3 weeks I found out this issue on its repository.
The llama-cpp-python needs to known where is the libllama.so shared library. So exporting it before running my python interpreter, jupyter notebook etc. did the trick.
For using the miniconda3 installation used by oobabooga text-generation-webui I exported it like bellow:
export LLAMA_CPP_LIB=/yourminicondapath/miniconda3/lib/python3.10/site-packages/llama_cpp_cuda/libllama.so

Voilà!!!!

response = requests.post(url, params=params, stream=True)

for chunk in response.iter_lines():
    if chunk:
        print(chunk.decode(""utf-8""))

","First, it wouldn't be good practice to use a POST request for requesting data from the server. Using a GET request instead would be more suitable, in your case. In addition to that, you shouldn't be sending credentials, such as auth_key as part of the URL (i.e., using the query string), but you should rather use Headers and/or Cookies (using HTTPS). Please have a look at this answer for more details and examples on the concepts of headers and cookies, as well as the risks involved when using query parameters instead. Helpful posts around this topic can also be found here and here, as well as here, here and here.
Second, if you are executing a blocking operation (i.e., blocking I/O-bound or CPU-bound tasks) inside the StreamingResponse's generator function, you should define the generator function with def instead of async def, as, otherwise, the blocking operation, as well as the time.sleep() function that is used inside your generator, would blcok the event loop. As explained here, if the function for streaming the response body is a normal def generator and not an async def one, FastAPI will use iterate_in_threadpool() to run the iterator/generator in a separate thread that is then awaited—see StreamingResponse's relevant source code. If you prefer using an async def generator, then make sure to execute any blocking operations in an external ThreadPool (or ProcessPool) and await it, as well as use await asyncio.sleep() instead of time.sleep(), in cased you need to add delay in the execution of an operation. Have a look at this detailed answer for more details and examples.
Third, you are using requests' iter_lines() function, which iterates over the response data, one line at a time. If, however, the response data did not include any line break character (i.e., \n), you wouldn't see the data on client's console getting printed as they arrive, until the entire response is received by the client and printed as a whole. In that case, you should instead use iter_content() and specify the chunk_size as desired (both cases are demonstrated in the example below).
Finally, if you would like the StreamingResponse to work in every web browser (including Chrome as well)—in the sense of being able to see the data as they stream in—you should specify the media_type to a different type than text/plain (e.g., application/json or text/event-stream, see here), or disable MIME Sniffing. As explained here, browsers will start buffering text/plain responses for a certain amount (around 1445 bytes, as documented here), in order to check whether or not the content received is actually plain text. To avoid that, you can either set the media_type to text/event-stream (used for server-sent events), or keep using text/plain, but set the X-Content-Type-Options response header to nosniff, which would disable MIME Sniffing (both options are demonstrated in the example below).

As you are using custom image with image_uri, it is likely that the image is not compatible with the SageMaker, and it is not trying to handle entry point script you specified.
To isolate the problem, please try to change your code to use SageMaker's official image. Then investigate why your custom image is not loading the entry point script.

inquiry about intent feature in openai and azure ai search integration,"I am interested in understanding the logic behind the intent feature in the integration between OpenAI's chat completions and Azure AI Search. Specifically, I noticed that when appending and sending chat history for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), there is a feature in the response named ""intent.""

how to handle a windows prompt in a test automation using cypress,"I am new to using Cypress for web automation. I am still scouring through the internet looking for answers to this but I cannot find a solution that works for me.
This is what I'm trying to do in my test:

User clicks a link. 
A new tab is opened and a windows prompt appears, requesting user input (username, password). (Since Cypress doesn't allow opening new tabs, I've removed the target attribute.)
Upon logging in successfully, the page has a download button.
User clicks on the download button.


The first struggle - I could not enter values into the windows prompt. In the below code, I was trying to see if the 'Sign In' button on the windows prompt would be clicked, but it was not.
cy.window().then(win => {
    cy.get('@documentPassword').then((finalPassword) => {
        const stub =cy.stub(win, 'prompt')
        stub.returns('test')
        cy.get('button#signin').click()
    })
})

I got an Assertion Error: Timed out retrying after 25000ms: Expected to find element: button#signin, but never found it. 
After no luck with this, I moved on to another suggestion.

The second struggle - I tried putting the username and password into the link, like this: https://username:password@mytestingwebsite.com. Just to note, when I paste the link manually into a browser, it works. To test this out, this what I had done:
cy.visit('https://mailtrap.io')
// ...other steps
cy.forceVisit('https://username:password@mytestingwebsite.com')

I added a custom command forceVisit to the commands.js file:
Cypress.Commands.add('forceVisit', url => {
    cy.window().then(win => {
        return win.open(url, '_self'); 
      });
});

The result is the second url does not load.

Several answers (like this, this and this) has suggested me, that I should look for .bash_profile and .bash_prompt files. Unfortunately, these two also are missing on both my computers.
Exactly what file decides about that under Windows 7? Where else should I look for, and what PS1 variable's value should be, to have current branch shown in green prompt on both machines?
","Git on Windows almost always uses a bash shell. So, it's not Git setting the prompt as much as Bash does.
There are two ways to set prompts in Bash. One is the PS1 command which is fairly flexible, but is limited to a particular set of escape character sequences. Unfortunately, Git information isn't one of those escape sequences (although I suspect it'll come someday). You can use the second way to set the prompt by setting the PROMPT_COMMAND environment variable. If this is set, the $PROMPT_COMMAND is executed and used as the prompt instead of the PS1 environment variable.
When you install the standard Git with BASH, you're Git prompt is defined under the /etc/profile file. By the way, etc is a directory under where you've installed Git which is usually under %PROGRAMFILES% unless you changed it when you installed Git.
Under the /etc/profile script in line #156 in my version, you see the PS1 command being set and using $(__git_ps1) in $PS1 as a means of executing an external command in the prompt. (A third way I didn't mention previously). 
The __git_ps1 is a shell function. You'll also notice a bit above (line #154 in my version) that /etc/git-completion.bash is being sourced in as well as /etc/git-prompt.sh. It's /etc/git-prompt.sh that defines the __git_ps1 function (Line #273 in my version) is defined. You'll notice that the __git_ps1 function pulls in several other functions defined in /etc/git-prompt.sh.
So, in a very Rube Goldberg manner, the Git prompt is being defined in /etc/profile via defining $PS1 which pulls in /etc/git-prompt.sh which defines a __git_ps1 function that pulls in the __git_ps1_show_upstream function and the __git_ps1_colorize_gitstring function. Then, $PS1 uses the $(...) string as part of pulling in the __git_ps1 function into PS1.
You can define your own $HOME/.bash_profile to override the way the prompt is set to define your own prompt. And, when you do that, you can also use the __git_ps1 Bash function in your own prompt.
Or, you can simply decide not to touch anything, and just back away very slowly. After all, you may have actual work to do.

the output, a_512 variable is a List with 11 items inside it

To access things I need, probably the 'label', I need to access the PIL.Image.Imagedata from each List item like this
(a_512[5][""mask""]

In the codes above, I used a variable to represent 5 in this code because apparently each image has different order of when it detects 'water' as the label and thus the required mask.
Because python can compare strings, I'm trying to make a for loop to check every items in the list of every 8752 images. Let's say some of the images can have 10-12 items like this output of the final run.

As you can see the index keeps increasing and didn't touch the last else of the if-else comparator, so it went out of bounds. I have tried this and using range on the for-loop but it didn't work and still went out of bounds. I put breaks and it stops the loop, I put continue it keeps went out of bounds.Which part did I do wrong and understood incorrectly about python comparator behavior?
I also tried logging it into .txt file or give status with print but it didn't go that way and always go out of bounds. Will gladly add more details if needed. The image is 512 x 512 size.

f.close()

Basically instead of selecting mask by checking the segmentation[mask_i][""label] I check if the 'cursor' or mask_i if it's smaller than the  length of the List (len(segmentation)). The += also contribute to the problem since it's adding first then change the number, as implied here and here, because of that my 'cursor variable' can move beyond the array size before checking the segmentation[mask_i][""label]. But I don't think I have other choice other than that to increment since =+ is just redefining itself.
Other than that I also add another while condition to make sure the code runs while the mask_i is below the size of the List, so the program become ""if it's still below the list size, check whether mask is ""water"" or not ""water"".
Although the program is finished and can mask most of the images, I still have to log several different images since not all of them had ""water"" as the label, but something close like ""Sea"" that we humans can intuitively say they are basically the same but computer that can only compare strings not.

does the answer quality of openai gpt4o from api change over time,"I'm creating an application that uses GPT-4 (via the OpenAI API) for visual question answering.
The problem is that tests using this module, which previously passed, have started to fail constantly due to a decline in the quality of the answers. Is this expected behavior for GPT-4 (or the OpenAI API)?
","If you use the gpt-4o as a model identifier in your application, then yes, the underlying model might change.
Let's take gpt-4o as an example:

as I write this, it points to gpt-4o-2024-05-13
but soon it will point to the newer gpt-4o-2024-08-06

It's a good question whether the quality of the answer can decrease in newer models. Companies use various metrics to ensure it doesn't happen. And the blind tests rating of AI models generally show that people rank newer models higher.
At the same time, it's easy to find anecdotal opinions that some previous models were better. At first, my impression too was that gpt-4 was better than the newer gpt-4o, but when I did a blind test, I preferred answers from gpt-4o.
If you prefer to stick to tested legacy model version, you can still use more specific id like gpt-4o-2024-05-13.

Instructions for Matching VHS Tape Details to Database Entry
~*~SURELY~*~  Confirm if both the title and VHS home video distributor from the OCR text match the database entry.
~*~POSSIBLE~*~  Indicate if only the title matches, and you're uncertain about the distributor.
~*~IMPOSSIBLE~*~  Indicate if neither the title nor the distributor matches, or if the tape and distributor are clearly not the same.
Guidelines
Focus on the title of the movie, VHS home video distributor (not theatrical distributor), VHS release year (not theatrical release year), and cast and crew members.
Consider that the synopsis was manually added to the database and may have discrepancies, and some missing information such the crew.
Explain your reasoning briefly, optimized for ML data training enrichment, but avoid rewriting details of all possible matches.

###Assistant:
- ~*~SURELY~*~ The title of the movie ""Psychic Killer"" match both in OCR extracted text and database entry. The distributor ""Embassy Home Entertainment"" also matches in both the sources. Although the release year is not mentioned in the VHS tape, it matches the common names of the cast members such as Jim Hutton and Paul Burke. Therefore, it is a confirmed match.

why langchain huggingfaceembeddings model dimension is not the same as stated on huggingface,"I was using langchain HuggingFaceEmbeddings model: dunzhang/stella_en_1.5B_v5.

len(embed_model.embed_query(""hey you""))

It gives me 1024.
Why this difference please ?
","According to the documentation at dunzhang/stella_en_1.5B_v5

how do i format an openai api request in swift,"I need to use the OpenAI API and am struggling to format the request. I started by referencing the curl code that is listed in the OpenAI API playground, and this code worked in my terminal. That request is here:
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \
  -H ""Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY"" \
  -d '{

  ""frequency_penalty"": 0,
  ""presence_penalty"": 0,
  ""response_format"": {

Then, I started working on translating that request into swift instead of curl. I've been referencing some YouTube tutorials, and here is my code so far.
let openAiUrl = URL(string: ""https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"")!

I am getting the error that says ""Consecutive statements on a line must be separated by ';'"" on the two lines that are using curly braces.

deploying llm on sagemaker endpoint  cuda out of memory,"I am trying to deploy huggingface LLM (for inference) to Sagemaker Endpoint using custom scripts (Using Pytorch framework with model and inference script zipped as .tar.gz file).  The tar.gz file structure is:

|- code/

In inference.py, I have defined functions model_fn and predict_fn.
This tar.gz file is uploaded to S3 and the model while deployment is being picked from this S3 location.
I have followed the process defined in https://huggingface.co/docs/sagemaker/en/inference --> Sections: Create a model artifact for deployment and User defined code and modules
After following all these steps, I am getting an error :

CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 20.00 MiB. GPU 1 has a total
capacty of 22.20 GiB of which 13.12 MiB is free. Process 13234 has
2.25 GiB memory in use. Process 13238 has 3.82 GiB memory in use. Process 13236 has 8.06 GiB memory in use. Process 13239 has 8.06 GiB
memory in use. Of the allocated memory 6.93 GiB is allocated by
PyTorch, and 49.59 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If
reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting max_split_size_mb
to avoid fragmentation.  See documentation for Memory Management and
PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF : 400

My model is an LLM with 7b parameters and compute is ml.g5.12x (192 GB  and GPU 24 GB x 4). The memory is more than sufficient (as I was getting this error, I tried such a large compute) and the code I have tried is using AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained and Autotokenizer.from_pretrained.  I have tried device maps of ""auto"", balanced_low_0, and balanced. The memory on GPU is sufficient to start with (as checked by me from memory summary)
The thing is I was able to get a response for a couple of pings and then I started getting this error. I am clearing the cache in my predict function but still I am getting this error.
How can I resolve my out-of-memory error? I get out of memory error either right at the start or my memory of GPU fills incrementally with each inference.
","I had tried a lot of different things as mentioned on various locations on web but none worked for me. The error was due to inefficient GPU memory allocation strategy for LLM (device_map=""auto"" was not working well for me) and some variables that were getting stored on GPU. I am mentioning variables because out-of-memory was appearing within first four inferences (which meant that empty memory available on GPU was very less to start with and the reason why I mentioned that the strategy of GPU memory allocation was not working for me).
Before I elaborate on my answer, I will list the various things I found at various locations and what finally worked for me (and I believe, most of the users who had faced this issue will most likely benefit from what I tried rather than the things mentioned below, even during training)

Update PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF max_split_size_mb. But this may be the least helpful option.
os.environ[""PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF""] = ""max_split_size_mb:enter-size-here""

A user at a different forum had mentioned that one needs to install following packages: transformers==4.28.1, sentencepiece==0.1.97, accelerate==0.18.0, bitsandbytes==0.37.2 and torch 1.13.1 . But I believe out of memory issues mostly need to be handled by memory management. Package issues might be temporary with new releases but are resolved with certaininity.

Related to Training ONLY - While training for vision models, the images might not fit in GPU solely and so you should adjust it’s size as well as release them from GPU memory.

Related to Training ONLY - Reduce training batch sizes to as small as 1

Garbage collection gc.collect()

Empty cache torch.cuda.empty_cache()

Increase system RAM/larger compute instance


What really helped me was distributing the LLM across GPU’s by defining max_memory of GPU that can be used for storing model. This meant that my GPU was not fully booked by the LLM. It is a three step process:

Load model with no weights/empty model on GPU.  While inference set
no_grad to avoid any calculations weight updates even though no
weights will be updated. Also, Set device map to fix the max memory
loaded model weights can take.

Load model weights on CPU

The weights for each layer are loaded to GPU, execution/calculation
is done and then, weights are removed from GPU.



    with torch.no_grad():
    
            with init_empty_weights():
                old_prediction_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
                    model_dir,
                    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
                    quantization_config=quantization_config
                    )
            model = load_checkpoint_and_dispatch(
            old_prediction_model, offload_folder=""/offload_folder_name_or_location"",
                checkpoint=model_dir, device_map=infer_auto_device_map(old_prediction_model, max_memory={0: ""10GiB""}),
                dtype=torch.bfloat16
        )

NOTE: Along with all this, another big cause of out of memory errors is leaving your variables on GPU i.e. since, execution is happening on GPU and during that course you try to create a list of model inferences or evaluations, the GPU memory will continue to fill up as your new inferences are made. To avoid it, with each inference take your variables off the GPU and to cpu memory

ensuring consistent response structure with gemini api,"I'm building a project that leverages the Gemini API, but I'm facing an inconsistency issue. Every time I send the same prompt, the response structure changes, making backend processing difficult.
The desired behavior is to receive responses with a consistent structure, regardless of content variations. This structure should ideally include:
An introductory paragraph 3-4 paragraphs containing the main content A concluding paragraph However, subsequent requests with the same prompt sometimes lack the title or begin with different elements, disrupting my processing pipeline.
Could you advise on how to achieve consistent response structure from Gemini API, even when the content varies?
","You don't give the prompt you're using to generate the reply, but in general, Gemini is better at following examples rather than following instructions.
So your prompt should probably look something like:
You will be asked a question. Your reply should include a title, a 
descriptive paragraph, and a concluding paragraph as illustrated below.

how to install and run ollama server in aws kubernetes cluster eks,"I can install and run Ollama service with GPU in an EC2 instance and make API calls to it from a web app in the following way:
First I need to create a docker network, so that the Ollama service and my web app share the same docker network:
docker network create my-net
Then I run the official Ollama docker container to run the service:
docker run -d --gpus=all -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama --net my-net ollama/ollama
Then I need to serve the model (LLM) with Ollama:
docker exec ollama ollama run <model_name> # like llama2, mistral, etc
And then I need to find out the public IP address of the Ollama service on this network, and export it as an API endpoint URL:
export OLLAMA_API_ENDPOINT=$(docker inspect -f '{{range.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' ollama)
And finally, I can pass this endpoint URL to my web app to make calls with:
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -e OLLAMA_API_ENDPOINT --rm --name my-web-app --net my-net app
With this, if you go to the following URL:
http://<PUBLIC_IP_OF_THE_EC2_INSTANCE>:8080
You can see the web app (chatbot) running and able to make API calls (chat) with the LLM.

Now I want to deploy this app in our AWS Kubernetes cluster (EKS). For that, I wrote the following inference.yaml manifest to run Ollama and serve the LLM:

Here, ollama-charlie-key: ollama-charlie-value comes from the node group I created with a GPU (g4dn.xlarge), and these are the key and value I gave to the node group.
But there's some problem because when I do kubectl apply -f inference.yaml, the pod shows as pending and I get the following error:
Back-off restarting failed container download-llm in pod ollama-charlie-7745b595ff-5ldxt_default(57c6bba9-7d92-4cf8-a4ef-3b19f19023e4)
To diagnose it, when I do kubectl logs <pod_name> -c download-llm, I get:
Error: could not connect to ollama app, is it running?
This means that the Ollama service is not getting started. Could anyone help me figure out why, and edit the inference.yaml accordingly?
P.S.: Earlier, I tried with the following spec in inference.yaml:
spec:
      initContainers:
      - name: download-llm
        image: ollama/ollama
        command: [""ollama"", ""run"", ""kristada673/solar-10.7b-instruct-v1.0-uncensored""]

          mountPath: /root/.ollama
        resources:
          limits:
            nvidia.com/gpu: 1

Where I do not specify the node group I created and ask it to use a generic Nvidia GPU. That gave me the following error:

That's why I moved to specifying the key-value pair for the node group I created specifically for this deployment, and removed the instruction to use a generic Nvidia GPU.
","I just went through the same thing while adding support for operating Ollama servers in the KubeAI project. Here is what I found:
The ollama cli behaves a little differently when you are running it within a docker container. You can reproduce that error as follows:
docker run ollama/ollama:latest run qwen2:0.5b
Error: could not connect to ollama app, is it running?

When you execute ollama run outside of docker, it appears to actually start up a HTTP API first, then the CLI starts sending requests to that API. When you run ollama run inside the docker container it is assuming that the server is already running (hence the could not connect part of the error). What you actually want to do in your instance is to just serve that HTTP API. The ollama serve command will do that for you. It turns out that serve is the default command specified in the Dockerfile: https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/1c70a00f716ed61c5b0a9e0f2a01876de0fc54d0/Dockerfile#L217
To resolve your error you just need to get rid of the command: part of your Deployment. This will allow ollama to start up and serve traffic.
The model will be pulled in and served when clients connect to the ollama Deployment (via your k8s Service) - either via a curl command or via running OLLAMA_HOST=<service-name>:<service-port> ollama run <your-model> from another Pod in your cluster.

Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier, the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function. Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret. In animal studies, most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior.',

from transformers import BertTokenizerFast

bert_tokenizer.decode(bert_tokenizer.encode(d0['question'], d0['context'])[56:61])
'isolated from the bloodstream'

I want to create a new dataset with the answer's token indices, e.g., 56 ad 60.
This is from a linkedin learning class. The instructor did the conversion and created the csv file but he did not share it or the code to do that. This is the expected result:
","You should encode both the question and context, locate the token span for the answer within the tokenized context, and update the dataset with the token-level indices.
The following function does the above for you:
def get_token_indices(example):
    # Tokenize with `return_offsets_mapping=True` to get character offsets for each token
    encoded = tokenizer(
        example['question'], 
        example['context'], 
        return_offsets_mapping=True
    )

    # Find character start and end from the original answer
    char_start = example['answers']['answer_start'][0]
    char_end = char_start + len(example['answers']['text'][0])

    # Identify token indices for the answer
    start_token_idx = None
    end_token_idx = None
    
    for i, (start, end) in enumerate(encoded['offset_mapping']):
        if start <= char_start < end: 
            start_token_idx = i
        if start < char_end <= end:
            end_token_idx = i
            break

    example['answer_start_token_idx'] = start_token_idx
    example['answer_end_token_idx'] = end_token_idx
    return example

Here's how you can use and test this function:
ds = load_dataset(""UCLNLP/adversarial_qa"", ""adversarialQA"")
tokenizer = BertTokenizerFast.from_pretrained('bert-large-uncased', return_token_type_ids=True)

tokenized_ds = ds['train'].map(get_token_indices)


# Example
d0_tokenized = tokenized_ds[0]
print(""Tokenized start index:"", d0_tokenized['answer_start_token_idx'])
print(""Tokenized end index:"", d0_tokenized['answer_end_token_idx'])

answer_tokens = tokenizer.decode(
    tokenizer.encode(d0_tokenized['question'], d0_tokenized['context'])[d0_tokenized['answer_start_token_idx']:d0_tokenized['answer_end_token_idx']+1]
)
print(""Tokenized answer:"", answer_tokens)

Output:
Tokenized start index: 56
Tokenized end index: 60

how can i optimize the data i am embedding to increase vector search result quality,"I am trying to implement semantic/vector search for images.
To do that, I am using gpt-4-mini to analyze an image and create data from it with this prompt:
Your job is to generate json data from a given image.
          
            Return your output in the following format:
            {
            description: ""A description of the image. Only use relevant keywords."",
            text: ""If the image contains text, include that here, otherwise remove this field"",
            keywords: ""Keywords that describe the image"",
            artstyle: ""The art style of the image"",
            text_language: ""The language of the text in the image, otherwise remove this field"",,
            design_theme : ""If the image has a theme (hobby, interest, occupation etc.), include that here, otherwise remove this field"",
            }

The data I am getting back is pretty accurate (in my eyes). I am then embedding the json with the ""text-embedding-3-small"" model.
The problem is that the search results are pretty bad.
For example: I have 2 images with only text. One says ""straight outta knee surgery"" and one says ""straight outta valhalla"".
When I search for ""straight outta"", I have to turn down the similary treshold to 0.15 to get both results.
This is my postgres search function:
CREATE
OR REPLACE FUNCTION search_design_items (
  query_embedding vector (1536),
  match_threshold FLOAT,
  match_count INT
) RETURNS TABLE (
  id BIGINT
) AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN QUERY
    SELECT id
    FROM public.design_management_items
    WHERE 1 - (design_management_items.description_vector <=> query_embedding) > match_threshold
    ORDER BY (design_management_items.description_vector <=> query_embedding) asc
    LIMIT match_count;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

When I go into higher numbers (0.5) there are pretty much no results at all. This seems wrong because in every tutorial I have seen they use a threshold of 0.7+
What do I need to change in order to improve the accuracy of my search results?
","Try to perform a hybrid search. All vector databases offer the hybrid search functionality.
As stated in the official Weaviate blog:

Hybrid search is a technique that combines multiple search algorithms
to improve the accuracy and relevance of search results. It uses the
best features of both keyword-based search algorithms with vector
search techniques. By leveraging the strengths of different
algorithms, it provides a more effective search experience for users.

In simple terms, performing a hybrid search means that you search with both keywords and embedding vectors, where you set the alpha parameter as a way to give a weight to these two. For example, setting alpha to 0 means keyword search only, while setting alpha to 1 means embedding vector search only.
I've created a project with a hybrid search in the past where you can search for Lex Fridman's podcast insights without watching the full episodes. See the demonstration.
Here's the weaviateHybridSearch.ts file:
""use server"";

import weaviate from ""weaviate-client"";
import { PodcastType } from ""@/app/types/podcast"";

// Define and export the queryPodcasts function
export async function queryPodcasts(searchTerm: string, alpha: number) {
  /**
   * Queries the Podcast collection based on a search term and alpha value.
   *
   * @param {string} searchTerm - The search term to query for.
   * @param {number} alpha - The alpha value to use for the hybrid search.
   * @return {Promise<PodcastType[]>} - The array of PodcastType objects representing the search results.
   */

  // Connect to the local Weaviate instance
  const client = await weaviate.connectToLocal();

  // Get the Podcast collection
  const podcastCollection = await client.collections.get<
    Omit<PodcastType, ""distance"">
  >(""Podcast"");

  // Perform the hybrid search on the Podcast collection
  const { objects } = await podcastCollection.query.hybrid(searchTerm, {
    limit: 10,

    returnMetadata: [""score""],
    returnProperties: [""number"", ""guest"", ""title"", ""transcription""],
  });

  // Process the results

I triend DOMContentloaded, window.onload, async, defer etc. It didn't work
","while (true) {
Unless used in say an async loop, this is never a good idea for Javascript, how the console behaves when the main Event loop is constantly blocked is likely undefined behaviour and should not be something you rely on.
Now there are 2 simple ways to solve this,

Use a setTimeout to continue the loop.
Use an async loop like pointed out above.

So for option 1 ->


function doLoop() {
  const r = prompt('type x to quit').toLowerCase();
  console.log(`you typed ${r}`);
  if (r !== 'x') 
    setTimeout(doLoop);
}

doLoop();  //lets start the loop



So basically in the above we are just replacing continue with setTimeout(doLoop), and removing the while (true) {
Now for option 2, using an async loop, this is the better option in the long run as it is much easier to expand on.


const breath = () => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve));

async function doLoop() {
  while (true) {
    await breath();
    const r = prompt('type x to quit').toLowerCase();
    console.log(`you typed ${r}`);
    if (r === 'x') break;
  }
}

doLoop();  //lets start the loop



Now in the above you can see we have used while (true) {, but the trick here when doing this you need to allow the event loop to run, this is what the breath function is doing.  The prompt function will still block, but those breath's will just allow some time for the event loop to do it's thing.  Also notice the async & await syntax, this is what does the magic to make what looks like sync code actually be async, and as such Browser / JS friendly.
Of course even better is not using prompt in the first place, most GUI libs these days have features for doing dialogs, and not only do these look nicer, they will also not block the browser main event loop like alert / prompt etc do.

how to extract information from a photo of a document,"I want to build a simple tool that will allow a user to take a photo of a document and extract information such as date/time and some other information

You don't need to train a model, there are different models out there that does what you need or solves this kind of problem, all you need to do is provided the llm your documents(images, text, pdfs etc) and ask questions on them.
However in some cases, if your pdf contains financial information such as annuity and the likes , You might need to train it for it to understand how to do those kind of calculations or better still write a function which inherits from Langchain_tool to instruct the llm on how to use it for those specific cases.

Step 2:
Find a library that converts images to text or pdf such as
Optical character recognition Library (OCR)
Step 3:
Find a vector_db(FAISS, chromadb and the likes) which converts text to vectors; this makes information extraction easy.
Step 4:
Feed your documents to the vector_db so it can convert it to vectors because numbers are good...

llama2 7bhf repeats context of question directly from input prompt cuts off with newlines,"Context: I am trying to query Llama-2 7B, taken from HuggingFace (meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf). I give it a question and context (I would guess anywhere from 200-1000 tokens), and ask it to answer the question based on the context (context is retrieved from a vectorstore using similarity search). Here are my two problems:

The answer ends, and the rest of the tokens until it reaches max_new_tokens are all newlines. Or it just doesn't generate any text and the entire response is newlines. Adding a repetition_penalty of 1.1 or greater has solved infinite newline generation, but does not get me full answers.
For answers that do generate, they are copied word for word from the given context. This remains the same with repetition_penalty=1.1, and making the repetition penalty too high makes the answer nonsense.

I have only tried using temperature=0.4 and temperature=0.8, but from what I have done, tuning temperature and repetition_penalty both result in either the context being copied or a nonsensical answer.
Note about the ""context"": I am using a document stored in a Chroma vector store, and similarity search retrieves the relevant information before I pass it to Llama.
Example Problem:
My query is to summarize a certain Topic X.
query = ""Summarize Topic X""

The retrieved context from the vectorstore has 3 sources that looks something like this (I format the sources in my query to the LLM separated by newlines):
context = """"""When talking about Topic X, Scenario Y is always referred to. This is due to the relation of
Topic X is a broad topic which covers many aspects of life.
No one knows when Topic X became a thing, its origin is unknown even to this day.""""""

Then the response from Llama-2 directly mirrors one piece of context, and includes no information from the others. Furthermore, it produces many newlines after the answer. If the answer is 100 tokens, and max_new_tokens is 150, I have 50 newlines.
response = ""When talking about Topic X, Scenario Y is always referred to. This is due to the relation of \n\n\n\n""

One of my biggest issues is that in addition to copying one piece of context, if the context ends mid-sentence, so does the LLM response.
Is anyone else experiencing anything like this (newline issue or copying part of your input prompt)? Has anyone found a solution?
","This is a common issue with pre-trained base models like Llama.
My first thought would be to select a model that has some sort of instruction tuning done to it i.e https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat. Instruction tuning impacts the model's ability to solve tasks reliably, as opposed to the base model, which is often just trained to predict the next token (which is often why the cutoff happens).
The second thing, in my experience, I have seen that has helped is using the same prompt format that was used during training. You can see in the source code the prompt format used in training and generation by Meta. Here is a thread about it.
Finally, for repetition, using a Logits Processor at generation-time has been helpful to reduce repetition.

","ChromaDB does not support large tokens of more than 768

how to wait until navigatornotificationprompt input has been given,"I am using a Cordova app to embed a React app. In a certain point, the user connects to the camera and a notification appears when a QR code is detected. I want that the code execution waits until user has entered his/her answer ""Yes/No"", but I can't get it to work. Notification prompt message works as expected though.
I need it to pause somehow, as in an async function (like  prompt would, for instance). How could I pause the code execution until the user has chosen Yes/No in screen? I guess with some async/await but don't see where... I have tried unsuccessfully so far:
let test = null;
let input2 = null;
notification = navigator.notification.prompt(""Do you know this QR code?"",
     async function(input) {
     input2 = input;
     test = await NotificationFunction(input, Camera_content);
     console.log(test)
     console.log('input2')
     return [test, input2]
     });

let test2= await notification
console.log(test2)
console.log(notification)
console.log(await test)

Thanks a lot in advance!
","Maybe you can use something like this:
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  navigator.notification.prompt(
    'Do you know this QR code?',
    async function (input) {
      test = await NotificationFunction(input, Camera_content);

sgaemaker training what39s the correct regex patrern to capture metrics,"This is the pattern I've seen suggested in a few different posts on SO:

The issue is, it fails to capture the e-0x after the digit. I've tried a few variant like these one: ([0-9]+(.*e\-)[0-9]+)\w+ which I have tested on https://regexr.com/. While it works on the website it still fails to capture the exponent part in CloudWatch.
I noticed the issue because my loss was going up and down, and when I checked the log directly I could see the loss was only going down, except every time it went from 1.254e-05 to 9.365e-06 only the first portion was captured, so it looked like the loss was just going back up and the model was not learning.
","The expression you used has some issues. It only works for ""1234e-05"", and doesn't work for ""1.234e-05"". Also ""."" has to be escaped with back-slash (""\."") to strictly match a period character.
Instead, please try (\d+(\.\d+)?(e-\d+)?)
I only tested on Python's regular expression module, but it should capture all following patterns.

how to disable the warning message for g4f version deprecation,"I am using this code to get my response out of the model :
from g4f.client import Client

client = Client()

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=""gpt-3.5-turbo"",
    messages=[{""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Hello""}],

This code is run through subprocess.Popen() call like so:
p = subprocess.Popen(['C:\\Python38\\python.exe','-Wignore', 'C:\\Users\\user\\proj\\projName\\chatgpt.py'],
                             stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, shell=True, env=env)

But the call to client.chat.completions.create() generates this warning message before actually returning the model response:
New g4f version: 0.3.2.4 (current: 0.3.2.2) | pip install -U g4f

My question is how to suppress that warning message from being generated by the mentioned call?
","You can suppress it using the warnings module:
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings(""ignore"")

Or, you can resolve the issue by upgrading the g4f package to the latest version via pip install -U g4f

You can also use sys.stdout to redirect standard output temporarily.
For example:
# Save the current stdout
old_stdout = sys.stdout

# Redirect all output that would normally go to stdout (e.g., the console) into a buffer instead
sys.stdout = io.StringIO()

# Call the g4f function that generates the warning here
...
...

# Restore stdout to its original state

","I believe the issue is in your generate_tokens method. Instead of returning a list of documents, it is returning a list of string. Please see the documentation for split_text here: https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/text_splitter/langchain.text_splitter.RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.html#langchain.text_splitter.RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.split_text.
I believe the fix should be to convert this list of string into a list of Document objects. Can you please try the following:
def generate_tokens(s):
  text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=100)
  splits = text_splitter.split_text(s)

  return text_splitter.create_documents(splits) #this should return the list of documents.

how to use the modal in the list in react native a specific modal for each list item,"I made a customized list component (in React Native) which shows touchable images with some description texts.
I need each images open a specific Modal; but I don't  know how!! where & how I should code the Modal??
... here is my photo list component:
export class CustomGallery extends Component {

  render() {
    let {list} = this.props;
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <FlatList
          numColumns={4}
          data={list}
          renderItem={({ item}) => (
            <View style={styles.views}>
              <TouchableOpacity style={styles.touch} >
                <ImageBackground
                  style={styles.img}

","For Modal you can use modal from material-ui - https://material-ui.com/components/modal/
The Modal component renders its children node infront of a backdrop component. Simple and basic example would be like a confirmation message that pops up asking whether you surely want to delete particular information or not.
From your code I am guessing you want to display information regarding the image using modal when you click on the image.
Here I have added Modal component:

    constructor() {

          snackOpen: false,
          modalDeleteOpen: false,
        };
      }

      
  handleModalOpen = () => {
    this.setState({ modalOpen: true });
  }

  handleModalClose = () => {
    this.setState({ modalOpen: false });
  }

    render() {
      let {list} = this.props;
      return (
        <View style={styles.container}>
          <FlatList
            numColumns={4}
            data={list}
            renderItem={({ item}) => (
              <View style={styles.views}>
                <TouchableOpacity style={styles.touch} >

","Since IO in Node doesn't block, you're not going to find an easy way to make something like this synchronous. Instead, you should move the code into the callback:

how to make huggingface transformer for translation return n translation inferences,"So I am trying to use this transformer from huggingface https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/tasks/translation. The issue is that I want n translations returned and not just one. How can I  do that? I mean, I want to have ordered translations, that means the translation with index 0 would have the highest confidence, this is important for my use case, which is about translating natural language to commands language (about 40 commands without subcommands).
The github repo and exact model is this one https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer/blob/main/t5/models/hf_model.py
This is the HuggingFace API:
translator = pipeline(""translation_xx_to_yy"", model=""my_awesome_opus_books_model"")
translator(text)

But I am intending to use the model directly from the google search github repo, so it seems some tweaking should be done here:
predictions = []
    for batch in dataset:
      predicted_tokens = self._model.generate(
          input_ids=self.to_tensor(batch[""inputs""]), **generate_kwargs
      )
      predicted_tokens = predicted_tokens.cpu().numpy().tolist()
      predictions.extend(
          [vocabs[""targets""].decode(p) for p in predicted_tokens]
      )

    for inp, pred in zip(inputs, predictions):
      logging.info(""%s\n  -> %s"", inp, pred)

    if output_file is not None:
      utils.write_lines_to_file(predictions, output_file)

Also any suggestion on some other model option to solve this natural language to cmd is welcomed!
","Check out the documentation of the generate method: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/generation_strategies#customize-text-generation
The parameter to use is num_return_sequences. But T5 by default does a greedy search, meaning it generates word by word and discards the options on its path there. To generate multiple options you need a selection of alternative paths. There are basically two ways to do this (my guess would be that for your case the first option works better):
If you activate do_sample, the model will not just pick the highest probability token at each time, but instead take a weighted sample from the distribution of next word probabilities.
predicted_tokens = self._model.generate(
          input_ids=self.to_tensor(batch[""inputs""]), num_return_sequences=3, do_sample=True, **generate_kwargs
      )

If you set num_beams to anything larger than 1, you switch to beam search, where for each further token the model follows multiple alternatives of next tokens.
predicted_tokens = self._model.generate(
          input_ids=self.to_tensor(batch[""inputs""]), num_return_sequences=3, num_beams=4, **generate_kwargs
      )  # note that num_return_sequences has to be smaller or equal to num_beans

To also get the scores of generated outputs you can additionally use the arguments output_scores=True and return_dict_in_generate=True, although you should note that these will return the logits of all individual tokens, which you then would have to put together to the overall probability yourself, check out https://stackoverflow.com/a/75029986/18189622.
In general, T5 might not be the best model for code synthesis, as of my knowledge it wasn't pretrained or fine-tuned on it in its Multi-Task Instruction Fine-Tuning. There is however FLAN-T5, which was fine-tuned on a wider range of tasks, including Code Synthesis. There are also CodeT5 and many other models relating to code synthesis.

embedding of llm vs custom embeddings,"I am new to topic of LLMs (been just 2-3 days) and I've encountered a potential issue in RAG Pipelines. Which assertion is wrong/right?

LLM models utilize the most fundamental units of processing as tokens. Tokens are created via tokenizers (will be specific to a model)

A token is passed into LLM sequentially (from the list of tokens at a time, which also determines the context window)

When ""training"", the ""embeddings"" are randomly initialized. After training , the embedding matrix is created such that there is an embedding for a particular token


Now in RAG, why is it that we are able to 'customize' our own embedding? I understand this helps with vectorsearch of already stored embeddings, but finally when you send all this to the model, does this ""bypass"" the model's embeddings and starts the inference process as it would? Also why don't RAG pipelines mention tokenizers often?
Went through multiple websites but process is abstracted everywhere
There's a mention of ""we create embeddings"" and then done!
","I found the answer....it was a silly little thing. The crux of the matter is , when you're extracting embeddings based on semantic search, the final result(no matter what comes) is ultimately going to be converted into text only, hence the name ""augmented"" generation - essentially a glorified mechanism of enhancing query context as far as this simple application is concerned
So essentially, the two processes (having some custom embedding in vector DB) vs embeddings in the model itself, are naturally separate and don't impact each other

a parameter cannot be found that matches parameter name 39all39 c,"I am trying to execute a command through c#.

how to create a popup using google apps script only if a certain button is pushed on the previous popup and remove text box,"My code below opens 4 text boxes, 1 asking a YES/NO question and 3 asking OK/CANCEL questions.

Questions are as follows:

What did we help this client with today? [textbox][OK/CANCEL] ***skip if previous answer is no
When should we follow up with this client next? (MM/DD/YY) [textbox][OK/CANCEL]

","SUGGESTION [SCRIPT UPDATED]
Perhaps you can try this tweaked script below. This will use the alert Class Ui method for the first question & an if condition to skip the order of questions if the user selects NO.
In my understanding, here is the flow you want to achieve:

The first question should not have a Textbox but only give the user to select YES or NO buttons.
If user selects NO on the first question, route the user to the third question instead.
Otherwise, the user will be prompted with the questions in order.


NOTE: This sample script will only process the first client on your sheet just like on your actual script. If I have misunderstood something Or if there's anything else missing, feel free to let me know.

  ['\n\n When should we follow up with this client next? (MM/DD/YY)', ""I""],
  ['\n\n Next Follow Up Activity?', ""J""]];


  var row = ""5""; //ONLY process current client on 5th row
  var clientDetails = sheetData[0].join('\n');

  /**First question */
  var q1 = ui.alert(clientDetails + questions[0][0], ui.ButtonSet.YES_NO)
  if (q1 == ui.Button.YES) {

oclif prompt testing,"I'm attempting to write a unit test for an Oclif hook that contains a simple prompt. I want to test the output of the hook, given a 'Y' or 'N' response to the prompt.

Here is how I deployed Llama 3.1 on the machine:

Pull the LLaMA Docker Image: Pull the LLaMA Docker image (in this case, ollama/ollama):
sudo docker pull ollama/ollama

This test was successful.

Test GPU Access: You can test GPU access by running a CUDA base image to confirm that Docker recognizes your GPU:
sudo docker run --rm nvidia/cuda:11.8.0-base-ubuntu22.04 nvidia-smi


Run the LLaMA Container: Run the LLaMA container with GPU access, mapping the host port to the container’s port without additional environment variables:
sudo docker run -d --gpus all -p 11434:11434 --name cybersage-lama ollama/ollama



I am not sure why it is underutilizing the GPU and everything is going slow.
","You need ~148GB of VRAM to run a 70B unquantised model (16FP). And ~ 48GB to run an INT4 quantised model.
You can see from the logs that 10 out of the 81 layers are in the GPU.
llm_load_tensors: offloading 10 repeating layers to GPU
llm_load_tensors: offloaded 10/81 layers to GPU

The other layers will run in the CPU, and thus the slowness and low GPU use.
I can see that the total model is using ~45GB of ram (5 in the GPU and 40 on the CPU), so I reckon you are running an INT4 quantised model). You can see some of this in the logs you shared
llm_load_tensors:        CPU buffer size = 40543.11 MiB
llm_load_tensors:      CUDA0 buffer size =  5188.75 MiB

To know the amount of memory required multiply the number of parameters by the size of weight.
16FP is 2 bytes so ~ 140GB. INT4 is 0.5 bytes = ~35GB. In practice one needs more than the bare minimum to run the model.

prediction logits using lxmert with hugging face library,"how can we get the prediction logits in the lxmert model using hugging face library? It's fairly easy to get in visualbert, but I'm not able to get it with the lxmert model. In case of visualbert model, the keys I'm getting are :
['prediction_logits', 'seq_relationship_logits', 'attentions']

and with the help of lxmert mode, the keys are :
['language_output', 'vision_output', 'pooled_output', 'language_attentions', 'vision_attentions', 'cross_encoder_attentions']

Even though there's a mention of prediction logits in the documentation I am not able to get them, if someone can help that would be great.

","Is your intention to load the model locally? Have you used create-react-app to initiate your project?
If so (and this might not be unique to create-react-app) I've noticed that on build, if you reference a file in your 'src' folder, it does not properly find the files (causing 'index.html' to be returned).
Try putting your local models under your project's 'public' folder. Then set the environment variable like this:
env.localModelPath = process.env.PUBLIC_URL + '/models/'

Also, apply env setting for local loading of the model:
env.allowRemoteModels = false;
env.allowLocalModels = true;

I did not train directly the BPE but the structure is the correct one so vocab and merges in a json. What I did was from a BPE trained by me (that was working) change completely the vocab and the merges based on something manually created by me (without a proper train).

detect empty value on prompt,"How to detect an empty value when user presses ok on prompt (and previously empties the prompt field)? I need to overwrite the old value with the new (empty) value. I'm doing this:
var oldVal = 'something';
var newVal = prompt(""Enter new value:"", oldVal);

Currently it returns null if user empties value and clicks ok.
But at the same time I need to check for null value because if user clicks 'cancel', it will return null, which I don't want as new value.
","It does not return null if the user hits OK - it will return an empty string.  You are probably not testing the return value properly.  If you want to test between the three different return states, you can do that like this:
var oldVal = 'something';
var newVal = prompt(""Enter new value:"", oldVal);
if (newVal === """") {
    // user pressed OK, but the input field was empty
} else if (newVal) {
    // user typed something and hit OK
} else {
    // user hit cancel
}

Working demo: http://jsfiddle.net/jfriend00/Kx2EK/

Your comment suggests that you're using this code to test the result:
if(!newVal || oldVal == newVal)return false;

When the user clears the field and presses OK, newVal will be """" (an empty string).  !newVal will be true so you will return false.  An empty string is a falsey value just like null.  You need to more explicitly check for null like this:
if (newVal === null || newVal === oldVal) {
    // cancel button was hit
    // or the same value was entered
    return false;
}

Working demo of this logic: http://jsfiddle.net/jfriend00/ynwBx/

get current directory without full path in fish shell,"A buddy of mine finally got me to start using Fish Shell and I'm trying to set it up similar to how I had Bash. The PS1 in my .bash_profile listed the current directory I was in, followed by a >. It, however, wasn't the absolute path (e.g. /Users/me/Documents/... or ~/Documents/...). If I was in /Users/me/Documents/projects/Go/project1/, the prompt would simply say project1 >.
Is there a Fish Shell alternative to the \W substitution available for Bash? Again, I just want the folder I'm in, not the full path. I know you can use the echo (pwd) for all that.
I have looked into the basename program, and echo ""${PWD##*/}"", but these appear to only work in Bash.
","Taken from @Jubobs' answer:
basename is just a Unix utility; it's not associated to a particular shell, and should work equally well in Bash and Fish.
It appeared I was using basename in the wrong context, and without a suffix.
This was solved by using the following:
function fish_prompt
    echo (basename $PWD) ""><> ""

how to send large videos to gemini ai api 15 pro for inference,"I'm currently working with the Gemini AI API 1.5 Pro (latest version) and need to send large video files for inference. These videos are several hundred megabytes each (~700MB) but are within the API's constraints (e.g., less than 1 hour in length). I want to upload them once and perform inference without re-uploading.
In GPT-4o, there was an option to use image_urls to reference images. Is there a similar method or best practice for handling large video files with the Gemini AI API 1.5 Pro?
The videos are too large to send repeatedly, so an efficient method for uploading and referencing them is crucial.
Any guidance on API endpoints, required parameters, or example code snippets would be greatly appreciated.

In this sample script, when the file has already been uploaded, the existing file is used. On the other hand, when the file is not found, the file is uploaded and the uploaded file is used. In order to search the file, in this sample, display_name is used.
Sample script 2:
As another approach, when the value of name can be directly given, the following sample script can be also used. In this case, the value of name is required to be the unique value in the uploaded files.

my zsh prompt is not bold,"I am customizing my zsh terminal but I face difficulties when it comes to turn my prompt into bold. I tried several different things, but none worked, whereas it did work for people on the Internet...

So this is my test prompt. Both ""HEY"" are in color 1, but the second ""HEY"" is supposed to be bold. It is obviously not, and instead of that, I get some flashy red, like the first part of my prompt, which is in color 9. wtf :)
Here is the code that I use in this case:
HEY%BHEY%b

I also noticed that it does the same thing for every one of the 8 first colors: black becomes grey, grey becomes white, night blue becomes dark blue, leaf green becomes flashy green, same for pink, yellow...
I also tried to use some escape sequences with the modulo, but none worked: each time, the modulo took the character next to it as its parameter and the rest of the code would just be displayed like normal characters.
For example, this:
PS1=""%{\e[1;33%}test""

would display this:
\e[1;33test

Could someone explain me what is going wrong here and how I could fix it to have some (real) bold prompt text?
","""ANSI"" colors (escape codes) has a ""bold"" attribute, but it is often interpreted as ""bright"" instead. You may have to look in your terminal application's options to see if you can reconfigure it to interpret bold as bold instead of bright. I think you have to choose between supporting ""bold"" and ""bright colors"". See also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors

","console.logs are actually asynchronous in that they are synchronized (as in always in order) but perform an asynchronous call.
prompt is a very old API and one of the few that actually blocks the page - so even-though it appears after the console.log you see it as soon as it is called.
That said - this is not true for every console nor is it guaranteed - the console.log may appear before the prompt depending on the browser/console implementation.

early stopping in bert trainer instances,"I am fine-tuning a BERT model for a multiclass classification task. My problem is that I don't know how to add ""early stopping"" to those Trainer instances. Any ideas?
","There are a couple of modifications you need to perform, prior to correctly using the EarlyStoppingCallback().
from transformers import EarlyStoppingCallback, IntervalStrategy
...
...
# Defining the TrainingArguments() arguments
args = TrainingArguments(
   output_dir = ""training_with_callbacks"",
   evaluation_strategy = IntervalStrategy.STEPS, # ""steps""
   eval_steps = 50, # Evaluation and Save happens every 50 steps
   save_total_limit = 5, # Only last 5 models are saved. Older ones are deleted.
   learning_rate=2e-5,
   per_device_train_batch_size=batch_size,
   per_device_eval_batch_size=batch_size,
   num_train_epochs=5,
   weight_decay=0.01,
   push_to_hub=False,
   metric_for_best_model = 'f1',
   load_best_model_at_end=True)

You need to:

Use load_best_model_at_end = True (EarlyStoppingCallback() requires this to be True).
evaluation_strategy = 'steps' or IntervalStrategy.STEPS instead of 'epoch'.
eval_steps = 50 (evaluate the metrics after N steps).
metric_for_best_model = 'f1'

In your Trainer():
trainer = Trainer(
    model,
    args,
    ...
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
    callbacks = [EarlyStoppingCallback(early_stopping_patience=3)]
)

Of course, when you use compute_metrics(), for example it can be a function like:
def compute_metrics(p):    
    pred, labels = p
    pred = np.argmax(pred, axis=1)
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true=labels, y_pred=pred)
    recall = recall_score(y_true=labels, y_pred=pred)
    precision = precision_score(y_true=labels, y_pred=pred)
    f1 = f1_score(y_true=labels, y_pred=pred)    
return {""accuracy"": accuracy, ""precision"": precision, ""recall"": recall, ""f1"": f1}

The return of the compute_metrics() should be a dictionary and you can access whatever metric you want/compute inside the function and return.
Note: In newer transformers version, the usage of Enum IntervalStrategy.steps is recommended (see TrainingArguments()) instead of plain steps string, the latter being soon subject to deprecation.

how to instantly terminate a thread using ollama python api with tkinter to stream a response from llama2,"I'm using ollama to stream a response from llama2 large language model. The functionality I need is, when I click the stop button, it should stop the thread immediately. The code below works but the problem is, it always waits for the first chunk to be available before it checks if stop is True. Sometimes the response can take some time before the first chunk is ready. It shouldn't wait for the first chunk. It should immediately stop the thread when stop button is clicked.
My code:
import tkinter as tk
import ollama
import threading

stop = False


# Create the main window
root = tk.Tk()
root.title(""Tkinter Button Example"")

def get_answer():
    print(""Start"")
    stream = ollama.chat(
        model='llama2',
        messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'write a story about earth'}],
        stream=True,
    )
    for chunk in stream:
        if stop is False:
            print(chunk['message']['content'], end='', flush=True)

        else:
            print(""Stopped"")   
            return
# Define the function to be called when the button is pressed
def on_button_click():
    global stop
    stop = True
    print(""Button clicked!"")

# Create the button
button = tk.Button(root, text=""Stop"", command=on_button_click)

# Place the button on the window
button.pack(pady=20)

thread = threading.Thread(target=get_answer)
thread.start()

# Start the Tkinter event loop
root.mainloop()

","You cannot instantly terminate a thread in python.
This ollama API currently offers an async client, you can use the async client and cancel the Task, this should close the async connection almost instantly.
import tkinter as tk
import ollama
import threading
import asyncio
from typing import Optional

# Create the main window
root = tk.Tk()
root.title(""Tkinter Button Example"")

client = ollama.AsyncClient()
async def get_answer():

        model='llama2',
        messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'write a story about earth'}],
        stream=True,
    )
    async for chunk in stream:
        print(chunk['message']['content'], end='', flush=True)


worker_loop: Optional[asyncio.AbstractEventLoop] = None
task_future: Optional[asyncio.Future] = None
def worker_function():
    global worker_loop, task_future
    worker_loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
    task_future = worker_loop.create_task(get_answer())
    worker_loop.run_until_complete(task_future)

# Define the function to be called when the button is pressed
def on_button_click():
    # the loop and the future are not threadsafe
    worker_loop.call_soon_threadsafe(
        lambda: task_future.cancel()
    )
    print(""Button clicked!"")

# Create the button
button = tk.Button(root, text=""Stop"", command=on_button_click)

# Place the button on the window
button.pack(pady=20)

thread = threading.Thread(target=worker_function)
thread.start()

# Start the Tkinter event loop
root.mainloop()

this does raise an asyncio.CancelledError in the worker thread, so you may want to catch it if you don't want errors on your screen, and you may want to wrap the whole thing in a class rather than relying on globals.

timing command execution from bashrc,"I'm trying to create my own minimal BASH shell prompt that times execution of each command entered. So far I have a functional prompt that looks appealing for my desires; I'm just missing the time output, like starship does. I've tried reading user input from $@, $*, /dev/stdin while using time without success. I also tried using date at the start of the script and end while subtracting the difference to a similar affect. No matter what I've tried the execution timing is always off or doesn't work at all. I've checked documentation and several sites for suggestions but none worked
The closest result I got was using this snippet below
function timer_start {
  timer=${timer:-$SECONDS}
}

function timer_stop {
  timer_show=$(($SECONDS - $timer))
  unset timer
}

trap 'timer_start' DEBUG

do those 0 make sense in making the variable,"The guide for fine-tuning Gemma with HuggingFace toolset is at: https://huggingface.co/blog/gemma-peft
Link to the line: https://huggingface.co/blog/gemma-peft#:~:text=Quote%3A%20%7Bexample-,%5B%27quote%27%5D%5B0%5D,-%7D%5CnAuthor%3A
The data entry formatter func is:
def formatting_func(example):
    text = f""Quote: {example['quote'][0]}\nAuthor: {example['author'][0]}<eos>""
    return [text]

Do those [0] make sense? they look wrong coz when printing out text variable I can see they are just characters instead of strings.
","Yes, variable example is a slice of dataset (a batch), not a one item from the dataset. In your particular case you have batch_size set to 1:
per_device_train_batch_size=1
It means that entire dataset is splitted into batches of size 1, i.e. arrays of size 1. So one batch is of the following representation:
[{""quote"": [""Quote 1""], ""author"": [""Author 1""]}]

So in order to get the values you use 0 as index.
Normally if you use batch size larger than or equal to 2 2, the representation would like:
[{""quote"": [""Quote 1"", ""Quote 2"", ...], ""author"": [""Author 1"", ""Author 2"", ...]}]

So in line with documentation you would like to use other formatting_func, where you iterate over both arrays like in this case:
def formatting_prompts_func(example):
    output_texts = []
    for i in range(len(example['instruction'])):
        text = f""### Question: {example['instruction'][i]}\n ### Answer: {example['output'][i]}""
        output_texts.append(text)
    return output_texts
